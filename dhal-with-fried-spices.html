          <strong>Dhal With Fried Spices</strong> is tiny little lentils with
          fried garlic & stuff, it's an absolutely <em>DELICIOUS</em> every day
          household staple in Indian homes. You seriously have to try this! The
          base cooked dhal flavour is infused and enhanced with: garlic, curry
          leaves dried chillies, red onions and fresh coriander. You will love
          this dish. The lentils are forming a base to carry slices of garlic &
          dried red chillies, fried with curry leaves, which gives it its unique
          flavour. Serve with a garlic & corriander naan bread, which I buy from
          the supermarket & store in the freezer until need, then just pop them
          in the toaster and dinner is served. If you're after a slightly more
          complex meal then try Onion bhaji as a side, they are delicious,
          nothing like those boring little round packaged items! Wait for my
          recipe &mdash; Its coming soon I promise! A day off meat will not kill
          you trust me. But just in case - Add in a chicken tikka starter if you
          must. You will soon find both these items in accompaniments &mdash; so
          watch that space ;-)

              <p>
                <strong>Dhal With Fried Spices</strong> is a really easy, stress
                free, nutritious and wholesome meal to make. Don't let people be
                put off by the word <em>lentils</em> as I use tiny little yellow
                moong dhal with equally tiny split red lentils, both of which
                cook down so much that they are virtually unrecognisable as
                lentils.
              </p>

              <p>
                I'm not too keen on lentil dishes made with large Chana Dal
                (split yellow lentils) or Chick Pea dishes myself, but this is
                not that type of dish I promise! Just use the word
                <em>Dhal</em> instead of lentils if you expect to meet
                resistance to lentils!
              </p>

              <p>
                Asafoetida is a powder that is used to add garlic flavour to a
                dish which is known as 'the devil's dung' due to its rather
                pungent odour! But, if you do not have any, don't stress you can
                still make this dish. If you decide to buy some keep the little
                pot in an air tight jar as it will make every thing in your
                store cupboard taste & smell like 'the devil's dung' lol!
                Seriously, it really does reek when fresh!!!
              </p>
