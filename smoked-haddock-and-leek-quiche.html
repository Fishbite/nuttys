          Who does not love a Pie! But Quiche is another level basically a
          lidless Pie. Not a stone cold solid thick pastry base with a tasteless
          filling like you get in the supermarkets. A freshly baked Quiche warm still
          from the oven. A delicate thin pastry base which is loaded with leeks,
          onion, double cream, eggs and seasoned to perfection! This is like the
          best cheese sauce in a PIE loaded with leeks & Smoked Haddock!
          Years ago I made this filling with just Smoked Haddock a little onion and cheese here I have tried to make it more affordable with the addition of leeks. Those were the days when a dish did not cost an arm and a leg... I hope you give it a go and enjoy the results.

                Our first job is too get our pastry base blind baked pre-heat
                the oven to 180c and greese your flan dish with a little butter.
                Then we can line our dish with the pastry tucking it in gently
                to all the corners and prick all over with a fork. Leave any
                over-hang this prevents your pastry shrinking below the rim of
                the dish. Next take a round of greese proof larger than the flan
                dish cover the flan dish and fill with rice or flour. I use rice
                store it away till the next PIE day arrives. Whelst it pre bakes
                you will have time too slice and wash your leeks. Finely dice
                your onions and prepare the seasonings. Lastly we will crack our
                eggs do our yolks and whisk then add cream stir it through. Be
                sure to keep a small amount of pastry aside just incase you have
                any holes during baking you can then plug the hole with a little
                fresh pastry!

                  Bake the base @ 180c for 10 minutes then remove the rice and
                  greese proff paper and return to the oven for another 10
                  minutes.

                  Add in 200g finely diced onions and 300g finely diced leeks.
                  Allow to soften with out colour. Do not use a lid as we need
                  them both to dry out as much as possibe.

                  *I use 330g frozen fish which meant I had to poach it gently
                  for 6 minutes in a little milk. Then remove the skin and top
                  your leek mixture with the fish.

                  Decorate with halved cherry tomatoes 1/2 per slice is a good rule of thumb ;-)

                <li>
                  Place the flan dish onto the oven rack and use a jug to pour
                  your cream and egg mixture into the flan dish. Do this slowly
                  as if it runs over you are going to have a big mess!
                </li>
                <li>Bake @ 180c for 30 to 35 minutes depending on the flan dish mines old fashioned heavy thick earthen ware so 30 minutes will be enough as it will continue to bake in the dish. If using a thin tin dish 35 minutes will porbably be required.</li>
                <li>Carefully trim the excess pastry with a sharp knife</li>
                <li>Allow to cool for 30 minutes to nearly room temperature to enable slicing & serve.</li>

              <h2>Serving suggestion</h2>
              <strong>Smoked Haddock and Leek Quiche</strong> 
              <p>A simple dressed salad and a few chunky chips or a thick slice simply served with hot Baked Beans. ;-)</p> 
                <p>Nutty Tip - If you have any left overs, chill in the fridge and give a quick blast in the microwave to warm or remove from the fridge an hour before you wish to serve as fridge cold Quiche tastes of nothing a bit like those ones we discussed earlier.</p>
