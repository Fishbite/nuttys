          <strong>Mediterranian Style Vegetables with Pork Steaks</strong> This
          dish is a wonderful mix of carrots courgettes aubergine & sliced fresh
          garlic. You to need to do a fair amount of chopping, creating various
          sizes of vegetable batons, i.e. each type of veg' needs to be of a
          certain baton size so that everything cooks evenly. Once that is done
          the dish is a breeze to put together. Italian dried herbs and oregano
          mixed with olive oil and tomato puree create a light sauce to
          compliment the vegetables. Delicious sliced peppers added to the bake
          with seasoned pork steaks that go on top of the vegetables after
          partly cooking. A final summery florish of fresh marjoram will
          complete the dish.

                Please refer to the pictures as a guide for the size of your
                batons. This is important as the carrots will take the longest
                to cook, with aubergines taking the least.

                Well! There's a little bit of choppin' to do for this dish, so
                now's the time to hone those knife skills! Pay attention to the
                size of those vegetable batons, the carrots particularly need to
                be the thinnest cut so that they have a chance of cooking before
                the soft veg' (aubergines, courgettes) turn to mush!

                And, what to do with the left-over veg'? Well, I pulled some
                more pork steaks out and put them in a marinade of olive oil,
                lemon juice, garlic and paprika &mdash; just enough to coat them
                and left them in the fridge overnight. Next day, I simply
                seasoned them with salt and pepper, chucked them on the grill
                and re-heated the left-over veg'. 4 to 5 mins and I have dinner
                for day two! ;Â¬)
