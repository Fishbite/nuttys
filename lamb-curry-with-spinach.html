        <p>
          <strong>Lamb curry with spinach</strong>, or <em>Saag Gosht</em> as it
          is known is from the Punjab, it's delicate and delicious, not overly
          spiced or indeed complicated. If you can make a shepards pie you can
          make this &mdash; it's easier! Bell peppers add texture, colour and a
          lovely flavour. As always&mdash;I like to use more vegetables than
          meat if the dish will take it. The Spinach is added right at the end
          retaining it's vitamins, minerals, flavour and vibrant colour.
          Preparation is not so important here as you have 20 minutes while your
          onions brown and you can also make your spice paste. Then you have
          another 25 to 35 minutes while your meat is cooking and you can chop
          your vegetables then &mdash; Loads o' time! ;-)

                It's that time again where I say
                <em>"brown the dreaded onions!"</em>
                but that really is the only work involved here &mdash; bar a bit
                of chopping, combining & stirring and the rewards are huge. So
                get all your ingriedients ready in the order that they are
                listed & let's cook. Try to use a pan with a glass lid so you
                can keep an eye on your dish while it is covered.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> Adding lemon juice at the end of cooking
                retains the fresh citrus taste of the lemon, the earlier you add
                it, the more bitter it becomes, which is what you want in some
                dishes, but not this one!

                Serve <strong>Lamb Curry with Spinach</strong> with plain boiled
                basmati rice, naan bread or, just with a parathas as it's a
                fairly dry curry making it the perfect finger food :¬P
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Nutty Tip:</strong> Now! Frozen spinach can be used in
                this dish but, please try to use whole leaves & allow them to
                thaw and drain prior to adding to your dish. You will lose some
                colour using frozen but, when in a rush!
              </p>
