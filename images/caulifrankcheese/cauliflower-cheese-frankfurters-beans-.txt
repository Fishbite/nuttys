Ingredients
for Cheese Sauce:
50g butter
50g flour
Pinch of Salt & black pepper
1 tsp Dijon mustard
1 tsp English mustard powder
1 tsp onion powder
1 OXO vegetable stock cube
150g extra strong (6) cheddar cheese ( save about a third for topping )
1 pint of whole milk

Method
Melt the butter in a pan
Add stock cube, flour, mustard and onion powder
Stir to form a ru (thick doey paste/balls]
Add whole milk slowly, a little at a time, whisk constantly
Gradually add more milk while whisking
You should eventually have a smooth clingy sauce that coats a spoon thickly.
Turn off the heat & add the cheese

Ingredients

Roasting Dish
1 large cauliflower, broken into florettes
Cut the florettes in half or quarter if too big
Keep the fresh cauliflower leaves
Pack of 8 frankfurters
3 small cherry tomato cut into half
1 tin baked beans
1 slice of bread crumbed

Method

Put the cauli' florettes into a large pan of cold water
Bing to the boil & simmer rapidly for 5 mins
Add cauliflower leaves for a minute
Drain & immerse in ice cold water
Drain well when stone cold

1 Tip the tin of baked beans into the a dish
2 Place the Frankfurters on top
3 Arrainge the Cauliflower florettes onto the Frankfurters
4 Pour the cheese sauce over the top and place your fresher leaves on top
5 Sprinkle the rest of the grated cheese and bread over
6 Top with your cherry tomatoes give them a twist of salt and black pepper
Cooking time temp.
Roast in the oven @180 for approximately 45 minutes
Or until the top is nicely toasted and the center warmed through
A sharp knife should easily go through the cauliflower stem with ease
The reason the timing can not be exact is every cauliflower is different
Some have a more open florette and no two are exact in size / weight

Description
This dish could easily be totally vegetarian just use vegetarian frankfurters (yummy)
Serve with a warm crusty bagette with lashings of butter and a dash of worchester sauce if it takes your fancy.
I buy bake at home bagattes as life is to short to make one (WINK)
