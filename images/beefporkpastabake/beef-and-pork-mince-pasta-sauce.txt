beef & pork mince italian pasta sauce

Now this is a favorite of mine "add wording from chicken pasta sauce and amend it...."

Feel free to use either of the minces alone but it will have a different texture and less flavour
Ingredients

3 x medium onions sliced
3 x carrots grated
3 x celery stalks finely chopped
5 x cloves of garlic finely chopped
450g beef and pork mince
8 x chestnut mushrooms quartered

400ml water

Method
Heat a large wok temp 6 ( or wide bottomed pan )
As soon as the pans hot is hot add a 3rd of the mince broken into strips with your fingers
Tip - fry your mince in 3 small batches. If you put it all in at once the temperature of the pan will drop and they will boil!
Wash your hands each time do each third pushing the cooked to the side
Once the mince is all browned set aside into a covered plate
Tip - The vegetables need softening not browning as such so temp 5 to 6

Once these vegetables have reduced by 2 / 3rds

Top top tip - Your not going to like this idea as your kitchen smells amasing and you just want too eat,  but until you,ve tried it you will never believe me. Allow the dish to cool competely set it in the fridge over night and reheat the next day or even two days later and the taste will have matured and be even better!
