As soon as the pan's hot is hot add a 3rd of the mince broken into strips with your fingers
Tip - fry your mince in 3 small batches. If you put it all in at once the temperature of the pan will drop and they will boil!
Wash your hands each time do each third pushing the cooked to the side
Once the mince is all browned set aside onto a covered plate 
add your cumin seeds
Tip - The vegetables need softening not browning as such so temp 5 to 6
Add your onions for 5 mins
Add your carrots for 5 mins

Add salt and pepper and dried herbs
Once these vegetables have reduced by 2 / 3rds
Push aside and add your mince and any juices back into the pan
Stir fry 'till all combined

Allow the dish to cool competely set it in the fridge over night and reheat the next day or even two days later and the taste will have matured and be even better!
