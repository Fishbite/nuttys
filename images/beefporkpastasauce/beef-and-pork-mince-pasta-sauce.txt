beef & pork mince italian pasta sauce

Now this is a favorite of mine "add wording from chicken pasta sauce and amend it...."

Feel free to use either of the minces alone but it will have a different texture and less flavour
Ingredients

3 medium onions sliced
3 carrots grated
3 celery stalks finely chopped
5 cloves of garlic finely chopped
450g beef and pork mince, combined weight
8 chestnut mushrooms quartered
2 Tbls tomato puree
1 400g tin plum tomatoes Pulped in a blender or mashed with a potato masher 
2 Tbls tomatoe puree
2 tsp italian mixed herbs
1 tsp oragano
1 bunch of fresh marjoram
1 OXO beef stock cube crumbled
1 OXO vegetable stock cube crumbled
1 Tbls Worchestershire sauce
1 tsp salt
1  tsp black pepper roughly ground
400ml water

Method
Heat a large wok med-hot ( or wide bottomed pan )
As soon as the pans hot is hot add a 3rd of the mince broken into strips with your fingers

Tip - fry your mince in 3 small batches. If you put it all in at once the temperature of the pan will drop and they will boil!

Wash your hands each time do each third pushing the cooked to the side
Once the mince is all browned set aside into a covered plate

Tip - The vegetables need softening not browning as such so med-hot
Add your onions for 5 mins
Add your carrots for 5 mins
Add your celery and garlic for 5 mins
Add salt and pepper and dried herbs
Once these vegetables have reduced by 2 / 3rds
Push aside and add your mince and any juices back into the pan
Stir fry till all combined, about 10mins
Push every thing aside again
Add your mushrooms, stir fry for 5 minutes
Combine all the ingredients in the pan
Add your tomatoe pulp, tomato puree, stock cubes & Worchestershire sauce 
Bring to a rapid simmer, add water and cover with a well fitting lid
Turn down to low-med for 15 minutes 
Remove the lid turn med heat and allow to reduce
lastly sprinkle in your marajoram


Top top tip - Your not going to like this idea as your kitchen smells amazing and you just want too eat,  but until you,ve tried it you will never believe me. Allow the dish to cool competely set it in the fridge over night and reheat the next day or even two days later and the taste will have matured and be even better!
