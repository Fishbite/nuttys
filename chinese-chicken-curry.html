          Now if you know Nutty's kitchen, I am always banging on about make
          your own paste's ect ect....Well here I break my own hard set rules.
          Why you scream! Well if you can buy a paste that really works to make
          a fast & easy <strong>Chinese Chicken Curry</strong> then do it! We
          have made numerous attempts to create this paste at home & tbh the
          faff & disappointment did not pay off. Dinner's ready in 30 minutes.
          We have for many years used
          <em

            <strong>Chinese Chicken Curry</strong> paste"</em
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          You can buy this in most decent Indian or Chinese shops & also
          Amazon&trade; stocks it. The pot will serve 8 individual curries & it
          costs just over £3 from our local independant, so if your after a
          <em>Home Away</em> that's really easy, and I believe a 6 year old
          could easily make this! So, here it is:-

                So! This is <strong>Chinese Chicken Curry</strong> just like the
                takeaway does it. And no, they don't make their own curry pastes
                either, I know, I've checked!
              </p>
              <p>
                Gather everything together and get it prep'd as this cooks at
                speed. Once you've done that you can put your rice or chips on
                to cook. By the time they're done, so will be your curry ::-)

                We didn't have to add the mushrooms to our
                <strong>Chinese Chicken Curry</strong>, but we just love it like
                that over at <em><strong>Nuttys Kitchen!</strong></em> We hope
                you enjoy it too, it's a fab favourite when we want a real treat
                with minimal effort ;¬) Enjoy!
              </p>

              <p>
                If you fancy chips! Do chips! With of course &mdash; salt &
                vinegar, I tend to use bone in chicken legs for
                <strong>Chinese Chicken Curry</strong> & chips ;-) Same process
                just increase the cooking time to 30 to 40 minutes & check they
                are cooked through
