          I've been called many things, but this is one of my favourites:-
          <strong>Fruit Cake!</strong> No Nuts included! Oh! Dear! Forgive me, I
          couldn't resist that one<span class="rotatetext">{:¬)</span>There are
          so many variations of this cake, but don't worry, this one is
          <em>probably the best <strong>fruit cake</strong> in the world!</em>
          It's easy to make and completely and utterly delicious with a cup of
          afternoon tea. I don't decorate my cakes with icing and stuff, as to
          be honest, I really can not stand it! Also, this cake could be served
          warm with custard, however, we're not doing that today
          <span class="rotatetext">:-P</span>
          The choice is yours as always though, so, feel free to knock up a
          crème anglaise at your leisure!

                This fruit cake is so easy to make that I know you wont have any
                problems! The main thing you need to do is soak your dried fruit
                overnight, this is to plump up them currents and raisins which
                will help ensure that your finished cake is wonderfully
                delicious and moist.
              </p>

              <p>
                It's taken me three attempts at combining three old recipes to
                perfect this. And, I baked it a second time, just to make sure
                that the recipe was perfect to publish!
              </p>

              <p>
                The only thing to take note of is the 'wetness' of the cake
                batter. You can see in the pictures that there is more fruit
                towards the bottom of the cake than the top. This is because the
                cake batter was a little on the wet side. That's why I say
                "start with 3 Tbps of milk & add a little more if needed.
                Practice will make perfect, but, personally, I'd rather
                guarantee that my finished cake is moist.
              </p>

              <p>
                So! Don't worry if your fruit sinks, you are still gonna love
                it!
