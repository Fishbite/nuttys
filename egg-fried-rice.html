        <p>
          This egg fried rice is so good, I could eat it all by itself. The rice
          is important here, I'm using easy-cook rice as the grains hold
          together, even if you try to murder it by cooking it for too long, so
          it's ideal for stir frying, especially this easy egg fried rice! I
          save even the tiniest amounts of left-overs and put it in a pot, cool
          it down as fast as possible and then pop it into the fridge. Then I
          might add it to an omelette for breakfast in the morning. It makes a
          seriously delicious egg fried rice omelette, try it for yourself :¬)
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to use another type of long grain to make fried rice, or
          egg fried rice, you must cook it the day before and leave it to chill
          in the fridge overnight, otherwise you'll end up with a complete wok
          of mush!

                Soak your rice in a bowl with water, stir around with your
                fingers and the water will become a cloudy milky colour, change
                the water at least once, or until the water remains clear when
                you give it a little stir, this stage is really important as it
                needs to have no starch remaining or it'll stick to your pan!
                Once it's done set it into a sieve over a bowl and let it drain
                until it's bone dry. You can use frozen or left over rice that's
                been chilled in the fridge overnight, but this easy-cook rice
                makes it fool proof without having to wait for the rice
                overnight!
              </p>
              <p>
                First of all, get all your ingredients ready, including the
                washed and drained easy-cook rice. Here's a pic of how I
                prepare:

                *have a lid to hand just in case it's still wet as it'll spit
                furiously and the rice will jump out of the pan. You can tell I
                have often been impatient and had this happen making a right
                mess I'm sure ;- )
