          As the weather is closing in. I'm going to move into my winter warmer
          dishes. Soups, stews, casseroles & dumplings &mdash; all those wintery
          cosy dishes. I'm going begin with my favourite one
          <strong>Beef & Mushroom Suet Pastry Pie</strong>. Here we are going to
          tenderise, brown and stew some meat, with the addition of whole, diced
          & finely chopped veg to create a wonderful hidden base to the sauce.
          Then make a really easy pastry that's like a browned off dumpling
          topping. I for one can not wait to eat this! It's calorific of course
          due to the suet pastry but, we are only making a top! Not encasing the
          entire dish. On a cold day when we need it I'm sorry! No actually! I'm
          not, it's still healthier than a take away or a sausage sarni! Oh my
          word! So delicious on cold wintery night!

              <p>
                When choosing a tenderizer be sure it's Papaya based &mdash; a
                natural tenderizer not salt. Find it at any chinese or indian
                shop. I'll change your world with one ingriedient. We cook our
                meat to death 'cause it's tough. Ha'ha Nutty's here! Stop paying
                electric to make meat tender! I see you're dubious. This is not
                how my mother cooked, it's not how I used to cook. It's
                knowledge from Indians, Ghanaians, they create magic from stuff
                we regard as too hard to cook!
              </p>

              <p>
                We'll brown our meat in a hot pan, so de-glaze it with the red
                wine (I'm using 300ml of Merlot) and add to the casserole dish
                or crock pot. I'm putting mine in a pressure cooker first for 18
                mins &mdash; yup 18 mins & the stew is done! If doing on a stove
                top or in the oven you're going to need an hour at least. Once
                it's tender-ish set aside to cool. You can not add pastry to hot
                stuff, you're just gonna get a mess! So you could make the stew
                / pie base the day before. I wish you luck, we have fridge
                raiders here so I wont risk it without the pastry top!.....

              <h2>Suet pastry topping</h2>

              <p>
                Dumplings & suet pastry are very similar but one's soft and oozy
                soaked with gravy, the other's a crispy topped lid soft and oozy
                from gravy on the under side. Both are equally delicious, but
                I'm opting for the pastry top this time.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Tip:</strong> the pastry contains flour so you'll need
                to be mindful of the consistency of your sauce as adding the
                pastry will also thicken your sauce. Your sauce should be
                slightly thickened right now. You're going to bake it again so
                having a taste of your sauce & checking it's consistency and
                seasoning is well worth doing here, once cooled it's going to
                change again &mdash; as the meat will absorb the juice.
                Remember, it's going to intensify yet again when you bake it. If
                necessary add a little water if you think it's going to dry out.
                Once you add the pastry top your opportunities to check have
                gone! Adding the top is our next stage so once you're ready to
                make pastry pre-heat your oven to 180c
              </p>

              <h2>the pastry</h2>

              <ol start="23">
                <li>Mix all the dry ingredients together</li>
                <li>Gradually add the water mixing as you go</li>
                <li>Form a pastry ball cleaning every last bit off the bowl</li>
                <li>Wrap the ball in cling film & put it in the fridge</li>
                <li>Let it rest for at least half an hour</li>
                <li>Lightly dust a board & a rolling pin</li>
                <li>Form a lid to sit on top of your stew</li>

              <p>
                Okay! We're all ready to put this pie together! A deep dish is
                required here, if our sauce bubbles upwards we don't want it to
                run over the top!
              </p>

              <ol start="30">
                <li>Add the cold stew to your deep dish</li>

              <p>
                I've done this and popped it in the fridge because tomorrow
                Nutty's Kitchen has a birthday to cook for! However, it will
                also give it time for the beautiful stewing juices to soak into
                the pastry lid &mdash; giving it an amazing dumpling texture on
                the underside with a golden crunchy top.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you did put it in the fridge overnight, bring it out and
                allow it to get to room temperature before you put it in the
                oven.
              </p>

              <h2>bake the pie!</h2>

              <ol start="32">
                <li>Brush the pastry top with milk</li>
                <li>Season with a little extra salt & pepper</li>
                <li>Put your dish onto a baking tray</li>
                <li>Place into a pre-heat oven @ 180c for 45mins</li>
                <li>Remove from oven when the top is golden brown</li>
                <li>Check it is piping hot in the center</li>
