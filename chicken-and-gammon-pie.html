          PIE? Well yes! Picnic pie, snack pie, dinner pie, packed lunch pie or
          even fridge raider pie...Every box has a tick here, chill it, eat it
          hot, do what you will with it, this is a pie in oh it's truest form.
          Please do me one small favour try not to eat this chicken and gammon
          pie alone, I can not held responsible for that!
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>A word about this chicken and gammon pie recipe:</b> It's quite a
          bit of work to put this recipe together, but don't be offput. The
          recipe starts off with the method to cook the gammon joint, however, I
          generally do this a day or two before and this week we had gammon and
          mash for Sunday dinner instead of a roast, but I thought I'd include
          the cooking of the gammon just so that you know what the
          <i>liquor</i> is, that is: the juice that remains after cooking the
          gammon which is quite essential to create the flavour of the sauce for
          the chicken and gammon pie. Please read on:
        </p>

        <p>
          So today we had gammon and being wise and mindful of my week ahead I
          kept my pressure cooker out and poached some boned and skinned chicken
          thighs in the hot gammon liquor the same day. Perfect! As it is
          seasoned by the gammon and all the stuff I added. I know it seems
          "Nutty" but hey this is a Sunday! So we have some time. We want to eat
          really well mindful of the devil electric. Again I'm using my pressure
          cooker, just 15 mins on meat setting. You can recreate the same if
          using your stove / hob top in 20 to 30 mins if using hot liquor and
          dependent on the size of your thighs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tomorrow I'll be making the pastry and sauce, constructing a pie and
          have both meats ready to be sliced cooked and chilled is ideal! You
          can not make pie with HOT STUFF! I reserved the gammon / chicken
          liquor in the fridge overnight as well to create the sauce to add to
          this chicken and gammon pie. Similar to my chicken Pie this, is HUGE
          and will take care of a lotta servings, unless you live in house with
          a Yorkshire man! Fridge thieves! Born and bred. Especially pies!

              <h2>Method for the pastry</h2>
              <p>
                Sift your flour and salt, I use my food mixer for this. Chop
                down your cold butter into cubes add into the flour. Blend until
                it becomes breadcrumbs check for lumps of butter. Add your egg
                whilst blending then begin trickling in your water, you may not
                need it all. Soon as it forms a ball take it out and set it in
                clingfilm.
              </p>

              <div class="card_image">

              <p>
                Put into the fridge for 30mins to rest and chill. Now you need
                to assess your dish, mine needs a third for top and two-thirds
                for the base.

              <h2>Method for the sauce</h2>

              <p>
                Firstly taste your gammon and chicken liquid: this is important
                as gammon can be very salty so we need to reduce or dilute. If
                it's tasty and right; reduce by half so you can add your milk.
                If it's too salty: only add <b>some</b> to your milk! Taste!
                Taste! Taste! Once happy the liquid we will then be added to
                your roux. Melt butter in a small pan and add all the other
                ingriedients bar the liquids.

              <p>
                Tip - Always put some sauce beneath as it's gonna bubble upwards
                keeping your meat moist. Sounds obvious but I thought it's worth
                a just mention. ( It's all to do with weight, meat is heavier
                than liquid NVM it's science stuff boring! )
              </p>

              <p>
                Continue making layers: gammon, sauce, chicken, sauce, optional
                mash potato & sauce! Repeat & continue until your dish is near
                full. It's gonna bubble all your sauce out if you over fill it!
                So don't mess it up, ya don't need the mess and a dry pie. It's
                an UGH moment if ya do, ya have been warned! Got the picture? I
                have done this :¬P

                Leave for a moment so the pie and you relax again now this is
                your moment.... Get a very sharp large knife cut out slice with
                confidence. The pie's still warm, the room's filled with that
                familiar pastry smell.
              </p>

              <p>
                Oops! Was the pie still too warm to cut? Yup! It ends up looking
                like this if it's not quite cool enough to cut, but it's still
                delicious:

                But! If you allow it cool enough, it should slice just fine :¬)

                Stand back and admire your layers if ya did the work right you
                should have this pink, white & pink all coated in a delicious
                sauce; The effort will vanish, if not you can buy something
                similar to this in the shops. Well um
                <img

                actually, a slice from the shop costs what 1/2 a pie costs; nigh
                on £3.50! It was way before covid and the cost of living crisis
                here. So if you make it, I congratulate you, the rewards are
                there for you! Effort = 2 | rewards = HUGE PIE + less money.
              </p>

              <p>
                Serve with? Well it's obvious, a small plate, knife and fork
                NOW! Or, you can make mash, carrots & gravy etc. etc. I'm having
                my slice now. Wary of the fridge raider. Enjoy :¬P
