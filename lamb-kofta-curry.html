        <p>
          This recipe for <strong>Lamb Kofta Curry</strong> is actually a
          Pakistani dish and not Indian. Nowadays, this is 'go to' dish for me
          when I want to treat me, yup just me lol. As it's like a kebab in a
          delicate curry sauce, not a fried kofta or kebab though. I have had
          that version & just for starters you need a BOTTLE of OIL just to fry
          your koftas! So, on the hunt for another method a few years ago, I
          discovered another technique! Place your koftas (kebabs) as you would
          do meat, into a curry sauce. I am not saying this dish is easy, but at
          least your home does not smell like a fish & chip shop! Less oil, but,
          still &mdash; flavour full to the max, what is not to love!? Big pants
          are not going to cut this alone, ya gonna need a glass of something
          fairly strong & some waders ;-) Read the recipe at least twice!
          Prepare, prepare, double check, take a breath & then cook with a
          smile! I have laid it out in 3 stages.... Yes I said your going to
          need to focus, 30 mins prep & about 50 mins to cook. But do not be
          daunted! Once learned it's easy, trust me! (I can see that shaking
          head thing your doing, but this dish from a restaurant for 4 people
          will cost you lots, about £40!!!) And I have always told you, I am
          Nutty! But, not to the point that I will pay for a curry... Save your
          money & buy a small food processor, as then this recipe is easy. If
          you do not have a processor everything will need to be
          <em>very finely chopped</em> for the koftas and then the meat mashed
          down with your fist, as the dish needs "ground" lamb, which of course
          is not minced, it's a paste basically, which gives you a delicate soft
          meatball.

              <p>
                <strong>*</strong>I prefer to use Greek yogurt as it creates a
                thicker richer sauce, but I have an Indian friend who will frown
                upon that. She knows who she is ;-)

                This dish really benefits from resting overnight in the fridge.
                But I would advise you to split it into individual portions
                before it cools, as this can be difficult once chilled. If you
                have a family to feed, or guests, just reheat & serve.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've broken this recipe into three stages; meatballs, curry
                sauce and then eggs! First thing you need to do is prepare your
                meatballs.

                <p>
                  <strong>Nutty's Note:</strong> I occasionally make the kofta
                  meatballs with a different type of minced meat, such as beef,
                  or, a pork and beef mixture, but, made with lamb mince is the
                  best and produces a lovely soft textured kofta, which is not
                  the case when using beef &/or pork mince, they tend to have a
                  much firmer consistency.
                </p>
                <p>Lamb koftas are to die for!</p>
