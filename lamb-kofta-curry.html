        <p>
          The recipe for <strong>Lamb Kofta Curry</strong> is actually a
          Pakistani version and not Indian. Nowadays this is goto dish for me
          when I want to treat me, yup just me lol. As it is like a kebab in a
          delicate curry sauce, not a fried kofta or kebab though. I have had
          that version & just for starters you need a bottle of OIL just to fry
          your koftas! So on the hunt for another way a few years ago, I
          discovered another technique! Place your koftas (kebabs) as you would
          do meat into a curry sauce. I am not saying this dish is easy, but at
          least your home does not smell like a fish & chip shop! Less oil,
          still flavour full to the max, what is not to love. Big pants are not
          going to cut this alone, ya gonna need a glass of some thing fairly
          strong & some waders ;-) Read it at least twice. Prepare, prepare,
          double check, take a breath & then cook with a smile! I have laid it
          out in 3 stages.... Yes I said your going to need to focus, 30 mins
          prep & about 50 mins to cook. But do not be daunted! Once learned it's
          easy, trust me! (I can see that shaking head thing your doing, but
          this dish from a resturant for 4 people will cost you lots, about
          £40!!!) And I have always told you, I am Nutty! But, not to the point
          that I will pay for a curry... Save your money & buy a small food
          processor, as then this recipe is easy. If you do not have a processor
          every thing will need to be very finely chopped for the kofta's and
          then the meat mashed down with your fist. As the dish needs ground
          lamb, which of course is not minced. It's a paste basically which
          gives you a delicate soft meatball

              </ul>

              <div class="spacer"></div>

              <h2>for the curry sauce</h2>

              <ul>
                <li>3 tbls vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 tsp cumin seeds</li>
                <li>1 bay leaf</li>
                <li>1 large white onion sliced</li>
                <li>1 large red onion sliced</li>
                <li>1 medium white onion finely diced</li>
                <li>2 medium (3 small) tomatoes sliced</li>
                <li>3 green chilli peppers, sliced</li>
                <li>1 large red chilli pepper sliced</li>
                <li>4 whole cloves ground</li>
                <li>1 inch cinnamon stick ground</li>
                <li>4 green cardamom pods ground</li>
                <li>4-5 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
                <li>1 tsp cumin powder</li>
                <li>1 tsp coriander powder</li>
                <li>1 & 1/2 tsp extra hot red chili powder</li>

                <li>1 400ml pot natural or greek yogurt</li>
              </ul>

              <div class="spacer"></div>

              <p>
                I prefer to use Greek as it creates a thicker richer sauce, but
                I have an Indian friend who will frown upon that. She knows who
                she is ;-)
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>2 cups water</li>
                <li>1 tsp garam masala</li>
                <li>1-2 tbsp corriander</li>

              <p>
                This dish really benefits from resting over night in the fridge.
                But I would advise you to portion it into individual portions as
                this can be difficult once chilled. If you have a family to
                feed, or guests, just reheat & serve.
              </p>
              <!-- Method List Goes Below Here!!! -->

              <h2>Method Meatballs</h2>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  Set your chilli's garlic & ginger into your food processor
                  process '-until finely chopped
                </li>
                <li>
                  Add the onion coriander & mint in. Use the pulse function to
                  chop so that the onions are finely chopped but not blended.
                </li>
              </ol>

              <div class="spacer"></div>

              <p>
                You don't want the onions to break down too much and release
                water.
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  Add the rest of the ingredients listed under meatballs and
                  process for 20-30 seconds or just until mixed.*
                </li>
                <li>
                  I roll immediately into two sausage shaped tubes of cling film
                  to the size I roughly want my kofta's to be. Set aside in the
                  fridge for at least 3 to 12 hours wrapped in the cling film.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Once you're ready & your sauce is on, using a bit of water to
                  wet your hands so the meat does not stick to your hands, form
                  into meatballs about 1 inch in diameter.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It should make around 25 meatballs. Set aside back into the
                  fridge if your not cooking immediately.
                </li>
              </ol>

              <div class="spacer"></div>

              <p>
                *The meat will change from red to a mid biege brown colour when
                done
              </p>

              <h2>Method Eggs</h2>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  This is easy! Boil them for 10 minutes & peel off the egg
                  shells (ROFL)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Once the shells are removed just pop them into your cooked
                  curry to absorb the flavour.
                </li>
              </ol>

              <div class="spacer"></div>

              <h2>method curry</h2>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  Heat oil in a large, heavy bottomed pan over medium-high heat.
                  Add the cumin seeds and allow them to sizzle for a few
                  seconds.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Add the sliced onions & diced and sauté, stirring often for 10
                  minutes, or until softened & slightly browned
                </li>
                <li>
                  Add the garlic and ginger, sauté for another 2 minutes until
                  the onions have deepened a little more in colour.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Add the tomatoes, spices and salt, stir fry until oil
                  separates from the spices
                </li>
                <li>Add green chilli pepper followed by the yogurt</li>
                <li>
                  Sauté for 4-5 minutes or until the oil starts to separate from
                  the mixture.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Add 2 cups water and increase the heat to bring to a boil.
                  Reduce the heat to the lowest setting.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Once it has stopped boiling, arrange the koftas in a single
                  layer.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Increase the heat to medium, cover and allow it to cook for 10
                  minutes.
                </li>
                "
                <li>
                  Uncover and gently stir the koftas. Reduce the heat to
                  low-medium.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Cover and allow it to simmer for another 35 minutes, stirring
                  once in between until cooked through.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Remove the lid after 20 minutes to evaporate water to make the
                  kofta to desired consistency.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Taste and add salt, if needed. Add in your garam masala
                  coriander & whole boiled eggs while the sauce is still hot to
                  infuse them in curry sauce
                </li>
                <li>
                  Eat immediately or set into the fridge overnight for the
                  flavours to infuse and you will have a perfect resturant style
                  dinner tomorrow
