        <p>
          If you like tomatoes, you'll love this
          <strong>Chicken & Tomato Balti Curry</strong> It is a wonderful curry
          but, be mindful to make it when tomatoes are truely in season and
          really flavourful. I bought vine ripened ones to create this dish, as
          they were absolutely beautiful and a decent price at the time. The
          best tomatoes to use are fresh (NOT tinned!!!)
          <strong><em>plum tomatoes</em></strong> as they contain considerablly
          less water, however, they come at a premium price that I'm not
          prepared to pay for on this occasion. I'll just omit adding any extra
          water to the dish. As a rule of thumb when buying tomatoes &mdash;
          smell them &mdash; if they are fairly odourless, they are probably
          just as tasteless and may have been kept in cold storage, which does
          them no good at all (shakes head!) Also, buy them few days before you
          need them, so as to allow them to ripen up a bit more and create more
          flavour. This is a nine step dish so it's really easy actually :-)
        </p>

        <h2>a bit more on tomatoes</h2>
        <p>
          If you want to make this dish when tomatoes are out-of-season, lacking
          in flavour and a little pale, you can add a tablespoon of tomato pur√©e
          to give the curry a boost. However, you can't beat the fully ripened
          in-season fruit that hasn't been chilled. When possible, buy from a
          greengrocer or independant supermarket that doesn't keep them chilled,
          it makes such a difference to the taste. And, while we're on the
          subject, never store your tomatoes or any other fruit in the fridge,
          they may keep a little longer, but they do lose bags of flavour :-(

                As I said in the intro, the best tomatoes for this
                <strong>Chicken & Tomato Balti Curry</strong> are fresh plum
                tomatoes as the contain very little water, however, I'm not
                paying the price they're asking unless I have Royalty coming for
                dinner!
              </p>
              <p>
                If you do use fresh plum tomatoes, you won't need to reduce the
                liquid so much in stage six.
              </p>
              <p>
                Apart from that, this is an easy curry to make that only has a
                few spices, so gather everything you need and you'll have it
                plated in no time at all.

                When you have such beautiful fresh flavours as there are in this
                <strong>Chicken & Tomato Balti Curry</strong>, the delicate
                flavour of plain basmati rice will complement them perfectly.
                Just sprinkle with a few more toasted sesame seeds and a sprig
                of coriander if you have them to hand.
              </p>
              <p>
                Please note: you can freeze this curry, however, it will squeeze
                out water from those tomatoes and will look a little runny
                &mdash; but still taste amazing!
