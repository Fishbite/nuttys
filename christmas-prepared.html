          <strong>Christmas Prepared!</strong> A collection of pre-made savoury
          snacks & sides that you can pop into the freezer & then the oven as
          soon as the time is right :-)
        </p>
        <p>
          So, Christmas is a week away and I'm super organised this year (I
          think, hope & pray!) with <strong>Christmas Prepared!</strong> Today I
          pre-made sausage rolls, sausage sage & onion stuffing, ready to be
          rolled into balls, and sausages wrapped in bacon. Add to those some
          bacon & cheese puffs and I have a load of savoury snacks ready to cook
          up on request! So, bearing all that in mind, I was sure to keep 3
          sausages for a sandwich, once I was done.... I have decided to post
          these to the recipe page, all in one batch, if you require more than
          I've made, simply multiply the amounts of ingredients accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll post pictures of everything cooked when they're cooked!!! Now I'm
          gonna have that sausage sandwich with those left over sausages!

                OK! It's time to prepare for Christmas! My idea here, is to
                gather a few simple ingredients and knock out a few different
                types of savoury snacks, as they all use similar ingredients
              </p>
              <p>
                The brilliance here is that, all this will be set onto a tray
                and placed into the freezer. Once frozen, I'll pop them into
                freezer bags ready to be pulled out over christmas or new year,
                all ready to be baked. Saves you loads of time and washing up
                when you just want to enjoy the festivities ;-) All can be baked
                @ 180c from frozen, for approximately 30 to 45 minutes in an
                uncrowded oven!
              </p>
              <p>
                NOTE: The pre-made pastry I buy comes wrapped in grease proof
                paper, which I use in the methods below.
              </p>

              <!-- Method List Goes Below Here!!! -->

              <h2>Method: Sausage rolls</h2>

              <ol>
                <li>first skin your sausages</li>
                <li>
                  simply run a sharp knife down one side, grab the skin and peel
                  back
                </li>
                <li>
                  on a large board, unroll your pastry on the grease proof paper
                  that the pastry comes in
                </li>
                <li>lay the sausages along the short length</li>
                <li>egg wash the short length of the pastry</li>
                <li>use the grease proof paper to roll</li>
                <li>take a fork and join the edge</li>
                <li>
                  cut the sausage roll away from the remaining pastry and repeat
                  twice
                </li>
                <li>turn each roll so the edge join becomes the base</li>
                <li>prick each top with a fork</li>
                <li>wrap all three in the greese proof & chill</li>
                <li>once chilled, check they are still sealed & freeze</li>
                <li>egg wash when you're ready to cook them is best</li>

                  sausage meat
                </li>
                <li>add a knob of butter to a bowl</li>
                <li>add the stuffing mixture</li>
                <li>now mix the stuffing with enough water to combine</li>
                <li>allow to cool completely</li>
                <li>
                  now mix your sausage meat into the stuffing & season with salt
                  & pepper
                </li>
                <li>wrap in clingfilm & set into the fridge to firm up</li>

                Once you have prepared everything, get a suitable tray that fits
                in the freezer, lay each separately, cover in clingfilm, or,
                greese proof paper, allow to freeze completely then place into
                labeled bags, so you can pull out exactly the amount you need,
                when you need it!
