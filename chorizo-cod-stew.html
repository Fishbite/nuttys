        <p>
          I hope you're ready for a divine treat today as I bring you this
          wonderful chorizo based dish. We absolutely loved it here at Nutty's
          kitchen, so much so, we had it two days on the trot with not a single
          morsel wasted!
        </p>
        <p>
          Baked <strong>Cod & Chorizo Stew</strong> is a gorgeous Spanish dish
          that is just so wonderfully tasty, really easy to make and completely
          scrumptious. The unique combination of savory, smokey, spicy flavours
          of the chorizo along with the aromatic fragrances of garlic, pepper
          and paprika permeate through the whole dish (and your kitchen!) making
          it a complete taste sensation that will please and satisfy any
          appetite. For a light bite in summer, eat with shredded iceberg
          lettuce warmed through the sauce and which ever bread you choose or
          have. On grey days or in the winter time, serve with creamy mashed
          potatoes to make this a dish of pure indulgent heaven! The starchy,
          creamy butteriness of the mash really lifts the flavour of the cod and
          makes the dish delightfully satisfying.

                Be sure to season each layer of vegetables with a little salt &
                pepper as you add them to the pan and don't forget to season
                your fish on both sides! I used a pointy sweet red pepper &
                cannellini beans but you could use butter beans if you prefer.
