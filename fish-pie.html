          Okay! So fish is way more expensive to the point of unaffordable these
          days. Tiny little bits from a supermarket are not what my mum used.
          But I am going to recreate the classic she served in her pub. Using a
          few tricks to bulk the fish out. Butter, veg and mashed potatoes. She
          literally used softened onions, white sauce, lots of cod &mdash; huge
          chunks of fish, a basic white sauce and a few peas and parsley. So how
          do we do that nowadays without buying a ready meal, which admittedly
          are cheaper? But, contain no real fish!! Difficult, Yup ya have no
          idea! But this is my answer to create
          <strong>Mum's Fish Pie</strong> on a budget. I managed to get 4 pieces
          of frozen Atlantic wild cod for less than four quid (£4) so that makes
          it reasonable if I can make it serve four.

                All the veg' needs to be cut to a very fine dice so that you
                never really know they're there in the final dish. Now, all we
                are after is a rich base sauce and if we make that on the stove
                top in a pan, it's going to take ages and ages :-( but, I want
                this to be something that you can put together a little more
                quickly. So, with that thought, I have my trusty microwave to
                hand! I'll soften the onions celery and leeks with a knob of
                butter in the oven-proof dish that I'm going to bake the
                <strong>Fish Pie</strong> in. I could just make a parsley sauce,
                but I find the dish really benefits from a vegetable base to
                elevate to another level completely. So, start with your veg'
                base and then create the parsley sauce in the same dish, then
                and only then, put your potatoes on to boil for 20 minutes.
                After that, turn to your fish. The packet says
                <em>'cook from frozen'</em> so, I lay the fish on baking paper
                on top of tin foil, wrap it up to keep the moisture in and then
                pop it in the oven until its thawed, but not quite cooked. How
                long for? 20 to 25 minutes @180c as a guide, but that really
                depends on the thickness of the fish, I checked mine after
                20mins and it was perfect, completely thawed, but not quite
                cooked, which is exactly how you want it because we're going to
                fully cook it in the pie.
              </p>

              <p>
                So, this is the idea, we have hot mash ready, hot sauce ready
                and fish ready to cook. With everything hot, it's really not
                going to take long to finish it off in the oven, So, break the
                fish up into chunks on top of the sauce and then give it a good
                mix before topping it off with the creamy mashed potatoes. Pop
                it in the oven for a while to brown the mash and cook the fish
                fully, and there you have it! My version of my mum's Fish Pie
                albeit, with not quite as much fish as she would have used but,
                with all the flavour that made this a family favourite and a
                smash hit with her customers.
              </p>

              <p>
                One important note here, seasoning is key, so taste everything
                as you go. And don't forget to season your fish with a good
                pinch of salt and pepper, it's really gonna need it to achieve
                that classic taste.
              </p>
