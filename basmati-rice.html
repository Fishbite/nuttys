        <p>
          Now this is so simple that I debated whether to do a recipe for
          <strong>Basmati Rice</strong> or not, but, it is suggested as an
          accompaniment to quite a few of my dishes and so many tell me that
          they struggle to cook rice well and have no idea how to assess a
          portion et cetera. So, I have decided to do a very quick write up of
          the method to cook the perfect <strong> Basmati Rice</strong>. Get
          small cup & lets begin... Here's a 4 portion example but just halve
          every thing if you want two portions, quarter if you just want one.
          See Simple! I'm cooking two portions for today and two for tomorrow
          ;-) saving time and energy

        <h2>Important!</h2>
        <p>
          Rice is actually dangerous if left warm and must be discarded if left
          out of the fridge for more than a few hours. The reason being is a
          bacterium that goes by the name of "Bacillus Cereus" which can cause
          food poisoning, and just to make matters worse, this nasty produces a
          toxin which <strong><em>CAN NOT</em></strong> be destroyed or made
          harmless by re-heating or second cooking at high heat &mdash; fried
          rice for example. Re-heating rice <em>IS NOT</em> the cause the
          problem, but, the way that it is stored before re-heating
          <em>IS!</em> So please be sure to cool it well with cold water & get
          it straight into a fridge or freezer if you are not serving it
          immediately. Then, be sure to reheat it properly. Batch cooking your
          rice is a perfect solution for just one or two people, but please do
          it safely and with care.
        </p>

              <p>
                So, this is my <em>goto method</em> for making perfectly cooked
                <strong>Basmati Rice</strong> with every grain of rice separated
                from the other.
              </p>
              <p>
                The main thing you need is a pan with a tight-fitting lid, you
                can get <em>rice pans</em> that are specific to the purpose of
                cooking rice &mdash; the lids have a rubber seal that makes them
                completely airtight, but, as long as you have a pan with a
                reasonably tight-fitting lid, you'll be fine &mdash; that's all
                I use, nothing special here!
              </p>

              <p>So, first of all:</p>

              <!-- Method List Goes Below Here!!! -->
              <h2>Wash the rice thoroughly</h2>
              <ol>
                <li>Get a medium-sized pan add your cup of rice</li>
                <li>
                  Fill with cold water - at least double the amount of rice
                </li>
                <li>
                  Stir with your fingers until the water is a milky colour
                </li>
                <li>Now drain through a sieve</li>
                <li>Rinse the rice again as above</li>
                <li>Repeat until the water is clear - or near as damn it!</li>
              </ol>

              <div class="spacer"></div>

              <h2>To cook the rice</h2>
              <ol start="7">
                <li>Add your measured rice & two cups of water & salt</li>
                <li>Bring to the boil covered with a lid</li>
                <li>
                  Soon as it is boiling turn the ring off completely leave alone
                </li>
                <li>After 20 minutes check all the water has gone</li>
                <li>Run cold water into the pan & drain into a sieve</li>
                <li>Rinse with more cold water leave to drain</li>
                <li>Check the seasoning & add salt if required</li>
                <li>Set into the fridge if not using immediately</li>
                <li>
                  Soon as it is dry set into a serving dish & heat in the
                  microwave for 4 minutes
                </li>
              </ol>

              <div class="spacer"></div>
              <p>
                You should have perfectly separated individual grains of rice.
