          <strong>Now, this is something really special</strong>—I would even go
          so far as to say <em>authentic</em> Indian food:
          <strong>Curry Leaf Masala Chicken Fry.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          A bit of research "Curry Leaves Masala is not tied to a specific
          region but is commonly found in South Indian cuisine. The use of curry
          leaves as a key ingredient is deeply rooted in the culinary traditions
          of states like Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh.
          These regions frequently use curry leaves in spice blends, chutneys,
          and curries to enhance flavor and aroma."
        </p>
        <p>
          This masala has a rich, earthy flavour with a distinct curry leaf
          aroma. I wouldn’t class it as hot, but some say I have the palate of
          an elephant’s foot! Probably from growing up with fresh chillies as a
          snack. &#128521; <em>But I digress…</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          This was introduced to me by an Indian friend, and I have to say, I
          was <em>thrilled</em> when he said, <q>You’ve made it well.</q>
        </p>

        <p><strong>Praise indeed!</strong> I mused silently to myself.</p>

        <p>
          I tend to make my spice mixes and even pastes the day before—reducing
          the workload when all you want to do is <em>eat</em>.
        </p>

        <p><strong>So, without ado, let's do this ting!</strong></p>

                The ingredients for this masala will make enough for three
                cooking sessions! The reason I've made it in this quantity is to
                use a whole bunch of curry leaves as bought from my local
                supermarket. The masala can be stored in an air-tight jar for
                about three weeks. Happy cooking :¬)

              <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> Adding the curry leaf masala in different
                stages helps to build up layers of flavours: spices that are
                really well cooked (this flavour dissapates through the entire
                dish) then some that are cooked a little and then some that are
                literally &mdash; <em>just warmed through</em>.
              </p>
