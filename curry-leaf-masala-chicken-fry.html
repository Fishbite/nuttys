          <strong>Now, this is something really special</strong>—I would even go
          so far as to say <em>authentic</em> Indian food:
          <strong>Curry Leaf Masala Chicken Fry.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          This masala has a rich, earthy flavor with a distinct curry leaf
          aroma. I wouldn’t class it as hot, but some say I have the palate of
          an elephant’s foot! Probably from growing up with fresh chilies as a
          snack. &#128521; <em>But I digress…</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          This was introduced to me by an Indian friend, and I have to say, I
          was <em>thrilled</em> when he said, <q>You’ve made it well.</q>
        </p>

        <p><strong>Praise indeed!</strong> I mused silently to myself.</p>

        <p>
          I tend to make my spice mixes and even pastes the day before—reducing
          the workload when all you want to do is <em>eat</em>.
        </p>

        <p><strong>So, without ado, let's do this ting!</strong></p>
