          <strong>Beef Curry with Green Beans</strong> is a delicate & fresh
          Indian style curry traditionally made with Lamb, however, I'm
          switching it up using beef for my version as I've discovered a
          <em>green papaya</em>
          based meat tenderiser that allows you to use an inexpensive cut of
          beef with ease. You know, the type of beef that you had to stew for
          hours to avert the risk of losing a tooth or two!
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Beef Curry with Green Beans</strong> is a very colourful dish
          with its green beans & red peppers in a thin un-thickend gravy. Fresh
          tomatoes and of course fresh chillies make a delicate, light curry
          sauce with a bit of a kick. I added Chapatis & basmati rice to
          complete the meal &mdash; see accompaniments for the recipes.

                *I've discovered a <em>green papaya</em> based meat tenderiser
                that has revolutionised my cooking, and what it does to meat is
                unbelievably brilliant! Just ensure that the one you pick up
                from the shops is <em>papaya</em> and <em>NOT</em> salt or
                chemical based. Papaya, or, paw-paw as it is sometimes called is
                a fruit from the tropical Americas. I've bought the fresh fruit
                in the past and tried to tenderise my meat with it, however, I
                didn't realise that I needed to shred the fruit into water and
                then add my meat to it. Doh! This powdered form of product is so
                simple to use though, and a bit cheaper than the fresh fruit, so
                it's a win-win situation :¬P
