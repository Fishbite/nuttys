          Cold weather is well and truly upon us around now and it's the perfect
          time for <strong>Nutty's Braised Steak</strong> in a rich gravy with
          shallots, leeks and whole chestnut mushrooms, which are absolutely
          delicious. I made this in my pressure cooker, but, it can be braised
          on a stove top, or even in the oven on long, low and slow.
          <strong>Nutty's Braised Steak</strong> is delcious with a creamy mash
          and vegetables of your choice. This is super quick to put together
          once your vegetables are prepared.

                There's just a little veg' to prepare for this dish and once
                you've got that job done, the rest is a breaze to put together.
                Just clean the mushrooms with some kitchen paper to remove any
                soil, then trim the stalks and pull them out of the mushrooms,
                so that they lay flat on each side as you fry them &mdash; put
                the stalks in to fry with the mushrooms! Then, you just need to
                pre-brown everything:- shallots, leeks, mushrooms and steak,
                putting everything into your chosen cooking pot as you go, then
                make the gravy / sauce and add that to the pot too.

              <h2>Indian Long Peppers</h2>
              <p>
                I bought these Indian Long Peppers a little while ago, for a
                specific recipe that I had in mind at the time, but, I never
                thought very much of them. However, I thought I'd give them
                another go and added them to this recipe. I'm so glad I did,
                they have a very subtle flavour, but definitely add a lovely
                warming and welcome heat to the dish, the kind of heat that
                makes you glow from the inside out :-) They're not exactly
                <em>edible</em> when cooked, so you will have to fish them out
                and / or warn your diners about them! They soften up a little
                when cooked and have a slight floral note to them when chewed
                &mdash; I had to do that! Just to really get a handle on exactly
                what they were, so, even though I say they're <em>optional</em>,
                it's well worth using them if you can, I think I had to order
                mine on-line, as I couldn't find them in my usual stores. You
                could use whole black peppercorns as a substitute, but the heat
                from them will be a little more ferocious.
              </p>
              <p>
                With all that in mind, get all of your ingredients ready, so you
                have everything to hand and to make sure you don't miss
                anything, which is so easily done!

                Mashed potatoes, sliced carrots & cabbage &mdash; wheres my
                fork?

                That ultimate, melt in your mouth steak, with a sumptuously rich
                and incredibly tasty warming gravy that will soften the hearts
                of all, guaranteed. This dish is not about the tender succulant
                steak it is all about sauce! A bit of effort pays huge dividends
