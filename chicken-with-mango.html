          <strong>Chicken with Mango</strong> Do not dismiss fruit from curry's
          it is a staple all over the world. Adding any fruits including mango
          will tenderise your chicken within minutes. The little addition of
          another layer of mango cubes, freshly chopped tomatoes and green
          chillies are delightful. The hardest bit of this curry is pealing and
          slicing the mango. Slippery little buggers! Do it over a deep dish to
          reserve all those juices to tenderise your meat. This is in no way a
          sweet or indeed hot dish, the balance of spices and fresh juicy
          sweetness are a perfect mathc for each other.

                Now the mango needs peeling throughly, the skins are tough and
                will ruin your quick cook curry instantly! So peel it over a
                dish so as not to lose the juices. Look for signs of the stone
                and cut arround the edge. Then slip your knife into the edge.
                Now, I tend to use my fingers to try and slip the stone out.
                Then once you have the stone, take a small knife and skim off
                any remaining flesh. First time &mdash; knightmare! But, once
                you get to know this fruit you will learn to love it :-)
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  So the mango challenge is done, now split it into two, as half
                  is for the marriande & the rest will be added right at the end
                  of the curry
                </li>
                <li>
                  Now lets work on the spices, it's easy! Grind any whole spices
                  you have like corriander with sea salt, it helps break the
                  seeds down
                </li>
                <li>
                  Combine with the ground spices, add garlic paste & ginger
                </li>
                <li>
                  Dice your chicken, combine the mango, spice mix & chicken
                </li>
                <li>
                  Set this aside into the fridge to marinate &mdash; just while
                  you do the dreaded browning onions "Shakes head"
                </li>
                <li>
                  Heat a heavy based pan, add the oil, once hot reduce the heat
                  add your onions
                </li>
                <li>
                  And yes wait wait, wait.. wait! When brownish add the curry
                  leaves & stir fry gently
                </li>
                <li>
                  Now add a tablespoon or two of your chicken mixture,
                  gradually! Try not to rush this stage please*
                </li>
              </ol>

              <div class="spacer"></div>

              <p>
                *If you chuck it all in at once it will boil. We want it to fry
                each side of the chicken and this requires some patience, I fry
                mine in about 50g batches
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  Once each batch looks white & it all looks, well stir fried
                  through the mango & onions, add the next batch
                </li>
                <li>
                  Now we add water just, to cover the chicken, I say 300ml but I
                  can not see your pan, just cover the meat
                </li>
                <li>
                  Now let it cook for 10 to 15 minutes with out a lid! We want
                  it to dry out so when we add our next stage it's a thick sauce
                </li>
                <li>
                  Now add your tomatoes, reserved mango cubes, green chilli
                  slices & fresh or frozen corriander
                </li>
                <li>Cover for 5 minutes to allow the dish to reheat & serve</li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                I hear many people say they do not like curry, that's because
                they maybe never cooked or controled a curry the way you can
                when you make it yourself. They are so diverse, step into
                Nutty's Kitchen rather than picking up the phone for a gloopy /
                greasy take away that you have no idea of how it was made.
