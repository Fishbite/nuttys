          <strong>Chicken with Mango</strong> Do not dismiss fruit from curry's,
          it is a staple all over the world. Adding any fruits including mango
          will tenderise your chicken within minutes. The little addition of
          another layer of mango cubes, freshly chopped tomatoes and green
          chillies are delightful. The hardest bit of this curry is pealing and
          slicing the mango. Slippery little buggers! Do it over a deep dish to
          reserve all those juices to tenderise your meat. This is in no way a
          sweet or indeed hot dish, the balance of spices and fresh juicy
          sweetness are a perfect match for each other.

                Now, the mango needs peeling throughly, the skins are tough and
                will ruin your quick cook curry instantly! So peel it over a
                dish so as not to lose the juices. Look for signs of the stone
                and cut arround the edge. Then slip your knife into the edge.
                Now, I tend to use my fingers to try and slip the stone out.
                Then once you have the stone, take a small knife and skim off
                any remaining flesh. First time &mdash; knightmare! But, once
                you get to know this fruit you will learn to love it :-)

              <p>
                Its great to serve this dish simply with plain basmati rice as
                its delicate flavour doesn't interfere with the vibrant tangy
                tastes of this magnificant curry..
              </p>

              <p>
                I hear many people say they don't like curry, and that's
                probably because they maybe never cooked or controled a curry
                the way you can when you make it yourself. They are so diverse,
                so, step into Nutty's Kitchen rather than picking up the phone
                for a gloopy / greasy take away that you have no idea how it was
                made.
