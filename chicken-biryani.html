        <h2>oven baked</h2>
        <p>
          Sure, I’m Nutty. And yes, I get that Biryani has a rep for being
          complicated. But honestly? It’s just rice, chicken, and a little spice
          magic. All myths removed. <strong>Chicken Biryani</strong> (One-Pot
          Style) is a simple and easy dish to make, but the flavours and
          textures are absolutely incredible. It features fragrant, flavourful
          rice paired with perfectly cooked chicken drumsticks. This recipe uses
          a special biryani masala from Chettinad cuisine, known as Chettinad
          Masala, which gives the dish a unique and delicious taste. One of the
          great things about this recipe is how forgiving it is—you can easily
          adjust the heat by using less fresh chilli's and chilli powder (though
          personally, I like it HOT! &#127798; &#65039;&#127798;
          &#65039;&#127798; &#65039;). Since the chicken and rice are cooked
          together in the same pot, this is a classic one-pot biryani. The
          process starts with grinding the Chettinad Masala, then sautéing
          onions and tomatoes with the freshly ground spices. Next, the chicken
          is added and cooked until it's halfway done. Finally, pre-soaked rice
          is placed on top and everything is baked in the oven at 180°C (350°F)
          for 45 minutes.
        </p>

        <!-- Second paragraph after the page title -->

          Okay, so the hardest part—as usual—is getting those onions nicely
          browned. It takes a bit of time, but trust me, they’re a must for good
          <strong>Chicken Biryani </strong>. Another not-so-fun job is taking
          the skin off the drumsticks. I know it’s a bit of a hassle, but it
          really makes a difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don’t worry about the bone end—it doesn’t have any meat on it anyway.
          Think of it as a built-in handle. &#x1F609;

                First, let's get the masala ready. In a dry frying pan, roast
                the spices for the masala powder until they become fragrant. Be
                careful not to burn them, as that will make the masala taste
                bitter. Once the spices have cooled, grind them into a fine
                powder and set them aside.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next, organize all your ingredients and start heating the oil
                and ghee. Place the rice in a bowl of cold water and let it soak
                for 30 minutes. Pre-heat your oven when you add the chicken
                drumsticks to the pan.
