        <p>
          Now, as the nights draw in and it gets colder & colder, I crave this
          kind of dish &mdash; <strong>Beef Stew & Dumplings</strong>. As I own
          a pressure cooker, I can cut the cooking time by two hours, If you
          don't, you can still make it, but be prepare to wait :-). I made this
          with small shallots, but you can switch it up with normal sliced white
          onions. Try to use chestnut or button mushrooms, as they add so much
          to the dish. I make this the day before then place into the oven @
          160c for 45 minutes to finish off, then it is perfects! That leaves
          plenty of time to create the perfect dumplings & mashed potatoes.

                There are a few way to cook this dish, the long ways, or, the
                short ways. I'm using the short way, in a pressure cooker!
                However, you can simply put it in a stove top pan and cook for a
                couple of hours, or, in the oven. Whichever way you choose, just
                cook it until the braising steak is litterally falling apart,
                which is normally about two hours in a pan/oven dish, or as
                little as 30 mins in the pressure cooker! I'll then let it cool
                and develop overnight, re-heating it in the oven the next day
                and adding dumplings for the last 30 mins.

                  on a plate, season the flour & rub your diced beef into it
                </li>
                <li>
                  add the beef to the very hot pan & do not move it for two
                  minutes
                </li>
                <li>

                  turn the pan heat down & add your onions, just cook slightly

                stuck on bits, & please only use wine you can drink! No cheap
