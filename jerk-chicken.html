          Now I have a passion for Indian, Mexican and all food as you have
          probably guessed. But there is another love in my life
          <strong>Jerk Chicken</strong>, after all variety is the spice of life
          :-) If you know me personally I have a habit of changing stuff up ;-)
          So how about a Caribbean dinner? <strong>Jerk Chicken</strong> is
          perfect finger food, or served as a meal plated with rice & peas. But
          my goto with this is Macoroni Cheeses Pie &mdash; comfort food at it's
          best! I say 'cheeses' because I use more than one type of cheese lol!
          Good news is you can find my Macoroni Pie in Vege Bakin' from the main
          menu along with rice & Peas as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          "A word of warning" I cut my chillies in half prepared for the
          photographer and wiped my hands on a tissue. A while later I wiped my
          nose DO NOT DO THIS! Scotch Bonnet chillies are lethal to any part of
          the skin. Let this be a warning to you... Yes there were tears! It's
          often advised to wear latex gloves when handling hot chillies, but
          Hey! Ho! That advice fell on deaf ears on this occasion, d'oh!

          to make <strong>Jerk Chicken</strong> with a few pictures as a guide.

              <p>Now as with Indian food &mdash; prepare to succeed!</p>
              <p>
                Indian food & Caribbean is the same process, if you do not
                prepare and get all your stuff out up front &mdash; it's going
                to create stress!!! You're going to miss something, then you
                will not enjoy the cooking process &mdash; taking in the aroma
                of dinner roasting away with all the prep' and mess gone. Tough
                to learn, but if you ever had 100 people turning, up never mind
                two, and your in a mess it's a bit of a nightmare. Prepare
                &mdash; get done &mdash; wash up &mdash; then cook & enjoy the
                process, the satisfaction you'll feel once that process is
                mastered and your guests arrive you will be chilled and
                confident &mdash; and not a ready meal in sight!

                Ingredients out chopping, board ready to go. I will grind all my
                spices in my electric spice grinder and chop everything in my
                blender. But Hey! Ho! If the knife is your way it's gotta be a
                really fine dice, then you will need to form a paste by bashing
                the diced fresh ingredients up in a pestle and mortar, or you
                could even crush them up on a chopping board with a rolling pin
                or heavy pan. Then you add your ground spices to the fresh
                ground stuff to make your Jerk paste, but, investing in gadgets
                is my passion &mdash; Oh! That & good food! So I'll mince my
                fresh ingredients in the food blender and then just tip my
                ground spices into it and give them a blitz to mix them all
                together to make the Jerk paste.
