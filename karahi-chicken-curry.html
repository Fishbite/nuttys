            >that is the understatement of the year &mdash; the editor
            comments!</em
          >) for that I do not apologise! But, if you are craving that true
          authentic take away or indeed expensive eat in restaurant
          curry....This is the one for you &mdash;
          <strong>Karahi Chicken Curry</strong>. Why I hear you ask, well 6 Tbsp
          of Ghee and then add in some whole spice seeds is the answer. When I
          first tasted this it transported me back to the other side of the
          world. One of those comfortable places you just want to curl up into
          with a spoon! It's not difficult to make, just a bit of time added to
          some patience and oh! Of course, a week in the gym might possibly be
          required after eating it! The dish utilises an Indian chef's trick of
          adding ghee to mellow the spices, which lends a luxurious, silky,
          velvety texture to the dish, as the ghee coats your tongue and makes
          the dish irresistibly impossible to refuse or avoid! And it's so good
          to eat, you just have to have this on your menu, occasionally :¬P

              <p>Here's how to make <strong>Karahi Chicken Curry</strong></p>
              <p>
                Do not be daunted! As curries go this is easy to put together.
                There is at first some nurturing to be done and of course those
                blimming "browned onions" the nemesis of any curry cook! But
                once everything's cooking with the lid firmly in place you can
                wonder off, contemplate the universe, economy or do some
                ironing! I will stay with my pot nurturing it, just because I am
                "Nutty" and need to know that I am not misguiding you into some
                burnt offering. As always try to have all your ingredients out &
                ready to use in the order listed. Get ya BIG pants on

                and lets do it.

              <p>
                <strong>Serving suggestion:</strong> Plain boiled or steamed
                rice is all you need for the perfect match to this dish, nothing
                else, except perhaps a heart monitor!
