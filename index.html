          <h2>Cooking on a Budget</h2>

          <p>
            Times can be tough when it comes to putting together a good square
            meal that is as tasty as you would expect to get in a decent
            restaurant. So I hope I bring you some inspiration and know-how in
            the pages ahead. The cost of ingredients and cooking is never far
            from my mind, so you will find very few lavishly expensive items in
            my dishes. Just lots of flavour
          </p>

          <h2>Bulking out with veg</h2>

          <p>
            Bulking out a dish with veg' is a very old-fashioned way of reducing
            costs, but at the same time, a way to add so much flavour! Veg'
            haters will never know they are there! Crafty, unless you tell them
            of course ;¬)
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout my recipes you will find that the base to most
            English-style cooking starts with, what is known as, the Holy
            Trinity! This is simply carrots, onions and celery, with a little
            twist here and there such as adding a little fresh garlic. Taste
            starts here!

          <p>
            Life can be so busy and hectic that sometimes you just want
            something super-fast. Every dish I cook will serve more people than
            I have to feed! This is my cunning ploy for those days when I just
            don't have time to prepare from fresh. You can freeze meal size
            portions of all my dishes (unless I specifically say otherwise!) so
            you can pull something out of the freezer in the morning, knowing
            that you have a delicious dinner waiting for you in just a few
            minutes. In fact, you will find that the depth of flavour develops
            nicely in most cases which is just another added bonus.

            As a super special treat for one of those big nights in, I've made
            my extra special <strong>Butter Chicken</strong>, which is a
            beautiful, rich and fairly delicately spiced curry. Not one to be
            eaten on a regular basis mind, as there are quite a few colories
            included, but it is oh! So umptious! I do hope you get chance to
