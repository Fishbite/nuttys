          <h4>Cooking on a Budget</h4>
          
          <p>
            Times can be tough when it comes to putting together a good square meal that is as tasty as you would expect to get in a decent restaurant. So I hope I bring you some inspiration and know-how in the pages ahead. The cost of ingredients and cooking is never far from my mind, so you will find very few lavishly expensive items in my dishes. Just lots of flavour
          </p>

          <h4>Bulking out with veg</h4>      
          
          <p>
            Bulking out a dish with veg' is a very old fashioned way of reducing costs, but at the same time, a way to add so much flavour! Veg' haters will never know they are there! Crafty, unless you tell them of course ;¬)
          </p>
          <p>Throughout my recipes you will find that the base to most English-style cooking starts with, what is known as, the Holy Trinity! This is simply carrots, onions and celery, with a little twist here and there such as adding a little fresh garlic. Taste starts here!</p>
