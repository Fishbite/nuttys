          Methi Murg is the Indian name for this dish and I am excited about
          this one!

          <strong>Chicken with Fenugreek</strong> is a delicate dish that uses
          one of my favourite herbs.
          <img

        </p>
        <p>
          I use fenugreek often in different forms. The seeds are highly prized
          and they release the most amazing aroma as you fry them in oil &mdash;
          my tech guy says:

        <p class="center">
          <em>"it always reminds me of Chinese curry, just wonderful!"</em>
        </p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p>
          The dried leaves are essential for many dishes but fresh leaves are my
          favorite delicate but powerful in so many ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          The biggest challenge is going to be those browned onions.....Patience
          as they say is a virtue! Add in garlic, ginger, green bullet chilli's
          and my interest is peeked to get cooking. Thank you to Romy Gill for
          sharing a delicious dish.

                Our first task is to get the chicken into it's marinade set it
                aside in the fridge for two hours. Allowing us plenty of time to
                do our dreaded browned onions you can use red or white, I did
                one of each adding colour or use which ever you prefer. Slice &
                dice your chilli's and prepare your spices. On a Nutty level
                this one is going to be a breeze :-). Totally intreged about
                using all the fenugreek including stalks here which is new for
                me so here goes my fingers are crossed! Hate striping leaves off
                fenugreek...I may never have to do it again this dish was
                amazing! Delicate spinich & bullet chilli's which are much
                milder than finger chilli's.

                  shall not bore ys with.) along with ½ tsp the ground turmeric,
                  1 tsp garam masala, ½ teaspoon salt and the 4 teaspoons of
                  single cream. Mix well to combine, then cover the bowl and

                  Heat the 60ml oil in a heavy based pan over a high heat. Once

                  6. I used my air fryer which is a mini oven grill absolutely
                  perfect no pre-heat required.

                <li>

                <li>
                  Whilst the chicken cooks. Re-heat the oil in the same heavy
                  based pan over a high heat. Then add the 1 tsp cumin seeds. As
                  soon as they start to sizzle, add the garlic and ginger and

                  teaspoon of turmeric, the 1 tsp ground cumin and 1 tsp ground
                  coriander the remaining 50 ml (3 tbsp) of cream and the cooked
