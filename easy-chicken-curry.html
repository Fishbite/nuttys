        <p>
          This is possibly my favourite home-made curry, it's a really easy to
          make and doesn't have too many ingredients, so it's a fantastic
          introduction to Indian cooking! Browning the onions is key to the look
          & taste of the final dish. Well browned onions result in a brown
          gravy, however, browning onions in little oil takes time and patience!
          This stage can not be rushed!
        </p>
        <p>
          The flavour & aroma profile is kind of Indo-Chinese, this is due to
          the use of Fenugreek seeds, which create such a fantastic & familiar
          Chinese curry smell, particularly when you add the garlic & ginger
          paste to the browned onions, your kitchen will be full of the most
          fantastic fragrances of spices you can imagine. The end result is a
          beautiful light tomato-ey sauce. I really hope you enjoy this curry as
          much as I do.

              <p>
                Browning the onions is key, but doing this with only a little
                oil takes a while, 15 - 20mins. Try not to stir too often while
                frying the onions, as this releases water, and they will take
                longer to brown. Just turn them over every now and again, so
                they don't burn. 20mins of your life browning onions feels like
                an eternity, but it is worth it to get the depth of flavour into
                the dish.
              </p>
              <p>
                Note: Adding lemon juice during the cooking process cause the
                lemon to have a slightly bitter taste, which is what we want
                here. If we wanted a lemony taste, we would add it at the end,
                just before serving
              </p>

                Whilst your onions are browning, you can prepare the ingredients
                for the sauce:
              </p>

              <ol start="14">
                <li>Tip the tomatoes into a bowl or jug</li>
                <li>Mash the tomatoes with a fork or masher</li>
                <li>Grind the coriander seeds & salt to a fine powder</li>
              </ol>

              <div class="spacer"></div>
              <p>
                <b>Tip</b> - If you do not have a pestle and mortar or a spice
                grinder, grab a zip bag, 2 chopping boards and a rolling pin or
                even a hammer put the coriander and salt in between the boards
                in the bag and bash rub bash then rub again it's very
                theraputic! You can even put the zip bag into a folded tea towel
                and bash them if you don't have two chopping boards ;Â¬)

                Go make a coffee whilst your onions do their stuff for the
                remainder of the 20mins!
              </p>
              <p>When your onions and spices are ready in the pan:</p>

              <ol start="21">

              </p>

                from my local Indian shop, it's cheaper and far tastier than the
                sad looking potted plants from the supermarkets. So, I just wash
                it, shake it, allow it dry in a tea towel & then chop it up,
                stalks & all then freeze it in a bag to keep
