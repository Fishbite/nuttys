        <p>
          <strong>Pork Madras</strong> curry sounds familiar? Well if you have tried my Beef and
          Pork (minced meat) Madras it will, but this is whole different ball
          game;-) <strong>Pork Madras</strong> is not something that you will see on any Indian takeaway or restaurant menu, 'cause folks from that part of the world don't eat pork. Here though I'm using <strong><em>shoulder of pork</em></strong>  that I brought as a
          whole joint and the diced down. Much cheaper than those pre-diced,
          pre-packed little boxes and all you need is a very sharp chef's knife.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Nutty's TOP TIP</strong> - There's less fat here than in minced meat so it is
          truely another level <strong>Pork Madras</strong>. If it's too hot for you, here's a little
          tip - add some ghee... Why I hear you screaming? Well the fat coats your
          tongue so the spices appear gentler, that's why when you buy a
          Take-Away it has buttery stuff sitting on the top... They added ghee
          ;-)
        </p>

        <p>
          So lets "Nutty" up some spicy peppery tamarind touched <strong>Pork Madras</strong>!
          This is truely spicy, so get your BIG PANTS <img
          src="./images/beef-pork-madras/pants.png"
          alt="pants image"
          title="big pants!"
          style="width: 24px"
          class="inline"
        /> on! First rule of thumb -
          <em> DON'T PANIC!</em> Get some little pots and take it step by step. You can still
          make this curry with a shop bought curry paste, it'll work, but nowhere near the
          level this home made paste reaches! I'm again going to share my <strong>Madras
            Curry Masala Paste</strong> with you, but I have some in the fridge left over from when I made my beef & pork madras curry, so I'll use that :¬P. The recipe for this paste is
          enough for 2 curries. It'll keep for ages in a sealed jar in the
          fridge - you only need 3 Tblsp! (I'm not going to re-tell my experience of
          forgetting the just 3 tblsp here!)
        </p>

        <p>
          To clarify, the flavour of any dish is difficult to articulate, but this <strong>Pork Madras</strong> is peppery tart
          from tamarind and spices, full of aromatic flavourings from star anis, cardamom, cloves and black peppercorns, every little slice of green chilli talks
          to your tongue. It's that memory of a <em>just got in from the pub with
            your Take-Away in hand </em>kinda curry that you wake up the next day &
          just want more of! Okay! I feel I'm rambling, so let's cook a Curry!

              <p>
                To make my <strong>Pork Madras</strong> curry, you'll need to
                have all the spices ready to go i.e. measure the spices out and
                put them into little pots and have all the other ingredients
                ready to use so that you can hit the road running with this one.
              </p>

              <p>Here's a couple of pic's to show how I prepare stuff:</p>

              </div>
              <div class="spacer"></div>

              <div class="card_image">
                <caption>
                  Ingredients prepared for the masala paste

                />
              </div>
              <div class="spacer"></div>

              <p>The first thing we'll do is make the <strong><em>Madras Masala Paste</em></strong> so, here we go:</p>

              <!-- Method List Goes Below Here!!! -->
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Put all your whole spices into one pot - not star anis
                </li>
                <li>Put the pre-ground into another</li>
                <li>Get a dry frying pan & heat to medium hot
                </li>
                <li>Put the whole spices into the pan</li>
                <li>Move the spices around occasionally</li>
              </ol>

              <div class="spacer"></div>
              <div class="card_image">
                <caption>
                  toast the whole spices
                </caption>
                <img
                  src="./images/pork-madras/650x366/whole-spice-toasting.webp"
                  alt="whole spices toasting"
                  title="Toasting whole spices gently in a pan to release their natural oils"
                />
              </div>
              <div class="spacer"></div>

              <p>
                Don't walk off 'cause spices burn easily. Once the aroma's fill
                the room and you see a shine to the pan - the spices have released
                their oil and are now ready to cool.</p>
                <p>I put mine into a pestle
                and mortar, so they cool quickly. Once cooled you can grind them
                to a fine powder and congratulate yourself for the work out ;-)
                I use an electric spice grinder as I have "0" patience and I do
                love a gadget!
              </p>

              <ol start="6">
                <li>Mix all the spices together</li>
              </ol>

              <div class="spacer"></div>
              <div class="card_image">
                <caption>

              <div class="spacer"></div>

              <p>
                Pop a little oil into a lidded pot & shake, that will make it easier to
                combine your mix, then add your finely diced ginger & garlic and the spices. Top up with just enough oil to wet the paste:
              </p>

              <ol start="7">
                <li>Put some oil in a pot</li>
                <li>Chop your garlic and ginger down finely & add to pot</li>
                <li>Add your spice mix</li>
                <li>Add some oil & mix to wet the paste</li>
              </ol>

                Once hot, get it to a consistency you're happy with and the peppers are to your liking. Find & remove the star anise if you can! Taste the
                dish, add salt sugar as required. Stir well & taste again ( add ghee
                if required ) adjusting the seasoning as needed. Once you are happy, add fresh or frozen
                coriander.</p>

              <div class="spacer"></div>

                <p>Setting the dish into a fridge overnight will
                improve the flavour as the spices will mature, I advise you to do this, but
                it is purely optional. Please be sure to tell your guests that the dish contains whole spices, especially if you didn't find the <em>star anis!</em>
