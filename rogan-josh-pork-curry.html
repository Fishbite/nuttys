        <p>
          You generally only find pork used in the dishes of southern India,
          however, here in the UK, it is one of the more affordable types of
          meat, so I frequently use it and try it out in dishes that normally
          use something else. This dish is a real treat, as pork is just perfect
          when slow cooked like this.
        </p>
        <p>
          My <strong>Rogan Josh Pork Curry</strong> recipe includes the method
          to make the curry paste too, but, do not be daunted! It really is
          quite simple to make your own curry paste, and as a bonus, you will
          have enough paste for several curries! Simply find a jar, sanitise it
          with a little white vinegar and boiling water. The paste will keep for
          a month. If you wish to keep for longer simply fry the paste off
          before storage. See simples ;-) This is a rich red pepper based curry
          paste and indeed curry. Here I am using pork, but you could easily
          substitute for lamb. This is a long, slow cook curry &mdash; 2 1/2 hrs
          &mdash; which will melow out the flavour perfectly. If you wish to
          make a chicken version, cook your sauce for 2 hours, then add your
          chicken.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>As always, Nutty has a short cut</strong>
          <em>
            &mdash; You can initially start the cook on the hob and then
            transfer to a pressure cooker for 18 minutes, then finish it off on
            the hob.</em
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          And while we're on the topic of short cuts, if you really don't have
          time, you could buy a shop bought Rogan Josh paste, but, it really
          does pay off to make your own, both in terms of authentic flavour and
          also cost, you'll get a lot more curries & flavour out of your own
          curry paste than you will from a jar from the shops. Added bonus
          &mdash; <em>no preservatives or colourings!</em>
