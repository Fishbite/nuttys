          Yup my "Nutty" side is in full swing today, so that calls for some
          spice and this is truely spicy. Firstly lets not panic as you read
          this. Get your BIG pants out
          <img
            src="./images/beef-pork-madras/pants.png"

          />
          and some little pots, then take it step by step. You can still make
          this curry with a shop-bought Madras curry paste, it'll work, but I
          thought I'd share my Madras curry paste with you, so you have the
          option not to pay so much for it and; have a new skill up your sleeve
          ;¬P The paste is enough for 2 curries and will keep for ages in a
          sealed jar in the fridge, you only need 3 tablespoons per curry! Read
          on for a bit of a giggle!

            🥜 On one occassion I had a very <em>“Nutty”</em> day and lost my 🚆
            train of thought.
          </p>

          <p>🍛 By mistake, I added the entire paste mix to a curry.</p>

          <p>
            As my two dinner guests 👥 began to 💦 sweat, I took a mouthful —
            still not realizing my error. Eating away, trust me… it was
            <strong>🔥🔥🔥 HOT to the point of fear!</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            🌅 The next day, realization finally dawned…
            <em>I had no curry paste left!</em> DUH!

                BE PREPARED! BE VERY PREPARED! That's what you need to do to
                keep your sanity when making any dish, especially those with
                large ingredients lists like Indian curries such as this Madras
                Curry. You could use a shop-bought Madras curry paste to save
                time, however, it will not taste the same as using my recipe
                here and will cost a little more than making your own.

                <b>A Note on Toasting Spices:</b> Toasting whole spices gently
                brings out the natural oils and enhances the flavour
                significantly, however, they can easily burn, so put them into a
                medium-hot pan and don't walk away. Move them around by shaking
                the pan &/or stirring them gently. You will know when they are
                done enough, because the aroma of spices will have filled your
                kitchen. Remove them from the heat and then tip them into a cold
                heavy bowl or plate to cool down completely before grinding them
                down to a fine powder. I tip them into my pestal & mortar which
                is made from thick stone, it's perfect for the job! Once cooled
                you can grind them to a fine powder and congratulate yourself
                for the work out ;-) I use an electric spice grinder as I have
                ZERO patience and I do love a gadget!
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Note on Browning the Mince: </b> brown the mince meat in
                small batches so that it does not boil as the water is released.
                You want the mince to be char-browned to give a really rich,
                deep umami flavour and dark brown colour to the final dish

                See, simple to make and it saved you a mile walk to the shop,
                saving you a little money at the same time. Yeah! And I
                guarantee that your home-made masala curry paste will taste far
                better than anything you can buy in the shop. A big bonus too is
                that you have total control over what ingredients that go into
                it, no unnecessary preservatives or flavour enhancers :¬)

                <b>*Tip:</b> If you are not sure if there is enough salt in the
                dish, take a little of the mixture from the pan on a spoon and
                taste it, then add a pinch of salt to some more on a spoon. If
                it tastes better you can add another level teaspoon of salt to
                the pan. Do that, stir and taste again. When happy with the
                seasoning:

                Setting the dish in the fridge overnight will allow the flavours
                to develop and enhance, but this is optional, I'm eating mine
