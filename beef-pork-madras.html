          Yup my "Nutty" side is in full swing today, so that calls for some
          spice and this is truely spicy. Firstly lets not panic as you read
          this. Get your BIG pants out
          <img
            src="./images/beef-pork-madras/pants.png"
            alt="pants image"
            title="big pants!"
            style="width: 24px"
            class="inline"
          />
          and some little pots, then take it step by step. You can still make
          this curry with a shop-bought Madras curry paste, it'll work, but I
          thought I'd share my Madras curry paste with you, so you have the
          option not to pay so much for it and; have a new skill up your sleeve
          ;¬P The paste is enough for 2 curries and will keep for ages in a
          sealed jar in the fridge, you only need 3 tablespoons per curry! Read
          on for a bit of a giggle!
        </p>
        <p>
          I have on a very "Nutty" day lost my train of thought and added the
          entire paste mix to a curry. As I saw my two dinner guests begin to
          sweat, I took a mouthful still not having seen my error, eating away
          trust me it was HOT HOT HOT to the point of fear! The next day
          realization dawned..... To clarify, the flavour of any dish is
          difficult to express into words, but, it's peppery, tart and sweet
          from the tamarind and spicy, every little slice of green chilli talks
          to your tongue.

                BE PREPARED! BE VERY PREPARED! That's what you need to do to
                keep your sanity when making any dish, especially those with
                large ingredients lists like Indian curries such as this Madras
                Curry. You could use a shop-bought Madras curry paste to save
                time, however, it will not taste the same as using my recipe
                here and will cost a little more than making your own.
              </p>
              <p>Here's a couple of pictures showing how I prepare everything so that I'm ready to make this dish:</p>

                <b>A Note on Toasting Spices:</b> Toasting whole spices gently
                brings out the natural oils and enhances the flavour
                significantly, however, they can easily burn, so put them into a
                medium-hot pan and don't walk away. Move them around by shaking
                the pan &/or stirring them gently. You will know when they are
                done enough, because the aroma of spices will have filled your
                kitchen. Remove them from the heat and then tip them into a cold
                heavy bowl or plate to cool down completely before grinding them down to a
                fine powder. I tip them into my pestal & mortar which is made
                from thick stone, it's perfect for the job! Once cooled you can
                grind them to a fine powder and congratulate yourself for the
                work out ;-) I use an electric spice grinder as I have ZERO
                patience and I do love a gadget!
              </p>
              <p><b>Note on Browning the Mince: </b> brown the mince meat in small batches so that it does not boil as the water is released. You want the mince to be char-browned to give a really rich, deep umami flavour and dark brown colour to the final dish</p>

A big bonus too is that you have total control over what ingredients that go into it, no unnecessary preservatives or flavour enhancers :¬)</p>

              <p><b>*Tip:</b> If you are not sure if there is enough salt in the dish, take a little of the mixture from the pan on a spoon and taste it, then add a pinch of salt to some more on a spoon. If it tastes better you can add another level teaspoon of salt to the pan. Do that, stir and taste again. When happy with the seasoning:</p>

              <ol start="35">
                <li>Add fresh or frozen coriander and stir well</li>
