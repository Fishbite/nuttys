          The much loved home made <strong>Victoria Sponge Cake</strong>. Shop
          brought cakes are great time savers and I have been known to buy this
          cake but, when it went upto £4 for a tiny one. I decided enough was
          enough! A room filled with the aroma of cake mix is one of my fondest
          childhood memories &mdash; sitting patiently waiting for the mixing
          bowl to be emptied, so I could attempt to find bits of cake batter
          left behind for my tiny hand to clean every last trace from the bowl.
          <strong>Victoria Sponge Cake</strong> is a true classic, and there's a
          reason for that &mdash; it's delicious! It's un-complicated to make
          and once you've done it you'll make it time after time ;-) I use a
          food mixer but this can easily be made by hand.

              <h2>for the cake batter</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>175g sugar*</li>
                <li>175g butter cubed*</li>

              <p>
                So if ever ya want to make a cake 3 x egg = 3 x 175g &mdash; See
                simple!
              </p>

              <div class="spacer"></div>

              <h2>to assemble the cake</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>200g strawberry jam</li>
                <li>100g Extra thick double cream</li>
                <li>Fresh strawberries - optional</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp icing sugar</li>

              <p>
                *I live in an appartment so having 20 different types of sugar
                is an issue. I put my granulated sugar into my blender and blitz
                it & <em>Hey presto Caster sugar!</em> I use salted butter as it
                makes the cake less sweet who knew ;-) Similar with flour, I
                only have plain & strong bread flour so I simply add baking
                powder to my plain flour. It's never failed me so, hey ho!

                Now listen carefully this is not a shop brought cake in a box
                all put together by machines. This is home-made and that's
                exactly what it should look like. So please do not stress if one
                sponge is a bit wonky. Or heaven forbid you can not get the jam
                to form a prefect layer. Even if your cream starts to drip down
                onto the plate smile make tea and say to yourself &mdash; I made
                that and it's perfect! Where's the forks? You're not on Bake off
                and I'm quite sure "Mary Berry" would agree it's perfect you
                made it. She could possible be critcal, but I take that on the
                chin :¬)

                If your Victoria Sponge Cake is for a special occasion take some
                extra cream and pipe around the edge of the top and decorate
                with fresh strawberries. Your cake's going to have one day shelf
                life if you add fresh fruit, so only do this if it's going to be
                finished on the day. If you put the fruit into a fridge it's
                going to leach it's juice, spoil your cake & lose it's flavour &
                just be dreadful. Strawberrie's are outta season as I write this
                so, no to the strawberries! Also, no to the piping arround the
                edge. My cake my way &mdash; some times basic's a good thing.
