          The much loved home made <strong>Victoria Sponge Cake</strong>. Shop
          brought cakes are great time savers and I have been known to buy this
          cake but, when it went up to £4 for a tiny one. I decided enough was
          enough! A room filled with the aroma of cake mix is one of my fondest
          childhood memories &mdash; sitting patiently waiting for the mixing
          bowl to be emptied, so I could attempt to find bits of cake batter
          left behind for my tiny hand to clean every last trace from the bowl.
          <strong>Victoria Sponge Cake</strong> is a true classic, and there's a
          reason for that &mdash; it's delicious! It's un-complicated to make
          and once you've done it you'll make it time after time ;-) I use a
          food mixer but this can easily be made by hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now! I was watching my favourite chef James Martin rustle up one of
          these beauties, made with strawberry jam as I have done in this
          recipe, however, as an alternative to strawberry jam he reckoned that
          if you fancy a change you can also make an apple version of
          <strong>Victoria Sponge Cake</strong>. No peeling and coring of apples
          required. No! All he used was a jar of bramley apple sauce, the exact
          same type as you serve up with your roast pork dinner. I thought
          <em>I've have try that</em> and low and behold, the results were so
          much better than than I ever imagined, you just have to try it, it's a
          revalation in cake making!!! I've included some pictures (pretty dodgy
          picutures actually!) of the results of this adventure at the end of
          this recipe. The ingredients and method are exactly the same for jam
          or apple, except the apple sauce of course!
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh! And the Nutty bonus &mdash; the jar of bramley apple sauce cost me
          £0.50 where as <strong><em>one cooking apple</em></strong> cost me
          £1.20! Seriously!

                So if ever ya want to make a cake 3 x egg = 3 x 175g each of
                butter, sugar & flour &mdash; See simple!
              </p>

              <div class="spacer"></div>

              <h2>to assemble the cake</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>200g strawberry jam</li>
                <li>100g Extra thick double cream</li>
                <li>Fresh strawberries - optional</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp icing sugar</li>

              <p>
                *I live in an apartment so having 20 different types of sugar is
                an issue. I put my granulated sugar into my blender and blitz it
                & <em>Hey presto Caster sugar!</em> I use salted butter as it
                makes the cake less sweet who knew ;-) Similar with flour, I
                only have plain & strong bread flour so I simply add baking
                powder to my plain flour. It's never failed me so, hey ho!

                Now listen carefully this is not a shop brought cake in a box
                all put together by machines. This is home-made and that's
                exactly what it should look like. So please do not stress if one
                sponge is a bit wonky. Or heaven forbid you can not get the jam
                to form a prefect layer. Even if your cream starts to drip down
                onto the plate smile make tea and say to yourself &mdash; I made
                that and it's perfect! Where's the forks? You're not on Bake off
                and I'm quite sure "Mary Berry" would agree it's perfect you
                made it. She could possible be critical, but I take that on the
                chin :¬)

                If your Victoria Sponge Cake is for a special occasion take some
                extra cream and pipe around the edge of the top and decorate
                with fresh strawberries. Your cake's going to have one day shelf
                life if you add fresh fruit, so only do this if it's going to be
                finished on the day. If you put the fruit into a fridge it's
                going to leach its juice, spoil your cake & lose its flavour &
                just be dreadful. Strawberries are outta season as I write this
                so, no to the strawberries! Also, no to the piping around the
                edge. My cake my way &mdash; some times basic's a good thing.
