        <p>
          Nutty's <strong>Jamaican Pumpkin Soup</strong> is no ordinary bowl of
          comfort — it's a cauldron of culinary chaos, blended into smooth
          velvety perfection! The roasted pumpkin, blackened at the edges like
          it's been kissed by the flames of mischief, oozes a deep, caramelised
          sweetness. But don't get too cosy — there's a fiery little Scotch
          Bonnet lurking in the pot, ready to slap your taste buds awake with
          its fruity heat! A riot of scallions, onions, and garlic join the
          madness, while a whisper of thyme keeps things just about civilised.
          Tender little bits of chicken dissolve into the mix, leaving behind
          pure, silky richness.
        </p>
        <p>
          But here's the twist — pumpkins, those elusive orange beauties, only
          grace us once a year around Halloween. No need to weep into your empty
          bowl, though — happily, butternut squash steps in as a worthy
          substitute, bringing just as much warmth and sweetness to the madness
          &#127875;&#128293;
        </p>
        <p>
          Spoon in at your own risk — this soup is pure Nutty magic! Inspired by
          all those wondeful Jamaican take-aways that we have here in the UK,
          especially Mama's Kitchen of Hemel Hempstead that used to be - come
          back we miss you!

                So gather your ingredients so that everything is to hand, it's
                so easy to miss something especially if you are a little nuts
                like me :-)
              </p>
              <p>
                First things first, you need to tackle the pumpkin or butternut
                squash that you are using, I'll just refer to it as a squash
                from this point on as it really doesn't matter which you use.
                You'll need a large sharp knife and a bit of muscle power!
              </p>
              <p>
                Carefully cut the squash into two pieces, avoid cutting through
                the stem as that is really hard. Next, take a spoon and scrape
                out all the seeds and fluffy bits from the center of the squash.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once your two halves are cleaned out, cut each half into
                quarters. Place the quarters on a baking tray and drizzle with a
                little oil and sprinkle with a little salt. Place in a
                pre-heated oven at 180C for about an hour. You want the squash
                to be soft and slightly caramelised at the edges.
              </p>
              <p>
                While the squash is roasting, you can get the rest of the
                ingredients ready and cooked
              </p>
              <p>
                Make sure to use all of the scallion, white and green bits, as
                this is an important flavour in jamaican cooking roots.
                Foundation of flavour is all in the roots of the cuisine you're
                cooking. Not available or understandable from a box! Ya have to
                understand it and adjust it to your taste! Luckily I did that
                work! Authenticity in food is really important to me. That is
                why I am Nutty!

                *I use a metal stick blender, as the last time I used a plastic
                one, the plastic went soft and deformed with the heat. I
                couldn't use that blender again as the blades damaged any pan I
                tried to use it in! Ho! Hum! We live and learn :-) *Editor
                altered this; HE DID THAT! Nutty knows plastic and hot do not
                mix..*

                Alternatively, carefully tip the soup into a blender and blitz
                until you have a silky smooth consistency.

                Sweet, smokey, herby flavours with an eye popping fruity heat
                that brings out a smile with every mouthful. It's one of those
                dishes that you first put into your mouth and think, that's a
                little sweet, then the rest of the flavours start popping out
                and dancing a merry riot on your taste buds :-) Enjoy the chaos!

                A perfect start to a jerked chicken dinner or Jamaican curry
                with macaroni pie. Or, just to enjoy on its own as complete
                comforting happiness.
