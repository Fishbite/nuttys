        <p>
          Prepare to liven up your tastebuds with this one! Whole thighs skinned
          but not boned are ideal for
          <strong>Chicken Thighs in Spicy Hot Sauce</strong> which is a rather
          grown-up sweet and sour dish. I have never found this on a Indian or
          chinese menu as it fits into both worlds. Garlic & ginger are dominant
          flavours as it is added at both the start and end of the cooking
          process. There is also an unmistakable <em>Zing</em> from fresh lemon
          juice and rind added at the end. It has a similarity to sweet & sour
          from your local chinese, but, oh! It's so not that... This is a very
          sticky rich sauce with the sweetness of the dish provided by the
          Tomato Ketchup base&mdash;for which there is no substitute, may I add.
          The paste can be made and stored in a clean jar in the fridge for
          weeks. The paste I am using is the last of a 5 curry pot that I made 6
          weeks ago, it has a shelf life of 3 months! So, yes there is work in
          making your own spice pastes, but well, the flavour profile will
          <em>WOW</em> you. Kashmiri chilli powder is mild in flavour with a
          vibrant red colour, so this is not a chilli hot recipe, but one that
          is so indulgently naughty that even the kids will adore it.
