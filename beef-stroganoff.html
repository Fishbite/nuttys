        <p>
          This is such a well known recipe & much loved, extremely rich and
          calorific so I felt it's time to re-invent the dish because, in my
          dream last night was what to do with that greek yogurt I had in the
          fridge ( I know how sad is that :-). It is still rich, moreish and
          delicious, but I have massively reduced the calory count by replacing
          sour cream with greek yogurt! No added butter! My
          <strong>Beef stroganoff</strong> also is cheaper as most recipes use
          FILLET steak &mdash; no no no, thats no! Nutty saves that for a very
          special occassion! I'm going to use braising steak bought as a whole
          steaks and sliced as 2.5 cm sliced cuts. Yes I will set it into my
          pressure cooker for just 20 minutes, it will take an hour at least on
          the hob or in the oven. I do finish it off for 30 minutes in the oven
          to split the yogurt & paprika giving it an oven baked appeareance. As
          with all my recipes &mdash; prepare to succeed &mdash; then you can
          cook faster! Slice, chop, be ready, saving on that darn electric cost
          :-)

                I find the packs of pre-cut / diced meat tend to be not so good.
                The chunks are never the same size and there's always bits that
                you really wouldn't want &mdash; excess fat, bits of grissle
                etc. :-(
              </p>
              <p>
                So, when I said use "whole" braising steaks, I meant it! I've
                brought a pack of 2 braising steaks and cut them to the size I
                want them &mdash; in to about 2.5 cm sliced pieces. Yummy! I'm
                so looking forward to eating this :-P

              <p>
                Now I had my mind set on pasta! But I live with a Yorkshire man,
                so it was mashed potatoes again! What is it with Yorkshire men &
                mash! Bang goes my calory reduction again.

              <p>
                I loved this dish so much that there was none left after just
                two of us sat down to eat. I guess we ate for three or four!
              </p>
              <p>
                I hope you enjoy it as much as we did here at Nutty's Kitchen
                :¬)
