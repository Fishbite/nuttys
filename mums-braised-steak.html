          <strong>Mum's Braised Steak & Mash</strong> Sounds simple enough, my
          mum often made this for a family of five. Nowadays, on her budget? I
          struggled to re-create it for the same value meal that it was. Cuts of
          meat such as brasing steak used to be so affordable, but not so today.
          I honestly think that price of the cheap cut's of meat, the ones that
          butchers used to practically give away, have been adversley affected
          by their popular use by TV chefs. I still think that my mum would have
          found a way though as she was a master at cooking on a budget! Even
          though the meat was a challenge for me and my budget, I felt it was
          important to include it in my website, as that is in some ways what
          this website is all about. It's around the anniversary of her death, I
          was 27 I at the time, I'm way older and wiser now (Not sure she would
          agree about wiser :-P ). Yet still, I remember every single recipe she
          made and how I loved to cook with her. Sorry! I digress, so back to
          the dish! Braising steak as I remember is hard to find in the super
          markets. It's thin scraps of meat no good for my mums recipe! She'd
          turn in her grave trust me! So I bought two 227g of the cheapest
          steaks I could find, vaccuum packed and not as thick as she'd have got
          way back when but it'll do for today.
