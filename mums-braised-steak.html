          <strong>Mum's Braised Steak & Mash</strong> Sounds simple enough, my
          mum often made this for a family of five. Nowadays, on her budget? I
          struggled to re-create it for the same value meal that it was. Cuts of
          meat such as brasing steak used to be so affordable, but not so today.
          I honestly think that price of the cheap cut's of meat, the ones that
          butchers used to practically give away, have been adversley affected
          by their popular use by TV chefs. I still think that my mum would have
          found a way though as she was a master at cooking on a budget! Even
          though the meat was a challenge for me and my budget, I felt it was
          important to include it in my website, as that is in some ways what
          this website is all about. It's around the anniversary of her death, I
          was 27 at the time, I'm way older and wiser now (not sure she would
          agree about wiser :-P ). Yet still, I remember every single recipe she
          made and how I loved to cook with her. Sorry! I digress, so back to
          the dish! Braising steak as I remember is hard to find in the super
          markets. It's thin scraps of meat no good for my mums recipe! She'd
          turn in her grave trust me! So I bought two 227g packs of the cheapest
          steaks I could find, vaccuum packed and not as thick as she'd have got
          way back then but it'll do for today.

                <strong>Mum's Braised Steak & Mash</strong> recipe is full of
                old fashioned flavour &mdash; we are aiming for a thick gravy
                and a totally melt-in-the-mouth steak. Our first task's to get
                that steak coated and well seasoned, after that is simples!
                Trust me! All were going to do is fry off the steaks and brown
                them really well and fast, then remove them from the pan and
                make our sauce in the same pan. One pan, one oven proof pot =
                happy days :¬)

              <h2>prep & pre-cook the steak</h2>
              <p>
                First things first, take your steaks out of their vacuum packs
                and allow them to come to room temperature on plate for a while.
              </p>

              <p>
                Mix the flour and all the other ingredients 'for the steak' to
                form a seasoned flour that we'll use to coat the steaks with.
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>Coat your steak in the seasoned flour<strong>*</strong></li>
              </ol>

              <div class="spacer"></div>
              <p>
                <strong>*</strong>Be be sure to really cover every bit of each
                steak evenly, and make sure you retain any remaining flour
                mixture. DON'T throw it away, we'll use it later for the gravy!
              </p>

              <ol start="2">
                <li>Heat a heavy based frying pan to maximum heat</li>
                <li>Once really hot add your oil</li>
                <li>
                  Flash fry your steaks so the outsides are browned<strong
                    >*</strong
                  >
                </li>
              </ol>

              <div class="spacer"></div>

              <p>
                <strong>*</strong>
                We only want to quickly brown the outside of the steaks as they
                will fully cook in the sauce.

              <div class="spacer"></div>

              <h2>Option 1: bake in the oven</h2>

              <ol start="16">
                <li>Put your dish into the oven @ 150c for at least 2 hours</li>
              </ol>

              <div class="spacer"></div>

              <p>
                When done, the meat should be completely tender so you can cut
                it with a spoon! Don't forget to find and remove the bay leaf,
                thyme and rosemary.
              </p>

              <h2>Option 2: Slow cooker method</h2>

              <p>
                Now see here, the issue is I can not see what meat you bought! I
                bought fairly cheap cut of steak that will braise just fine in
                the oven, however, a second option is to pop it into a slow
                cooker on low for 4 hours giving you plenty of time to work on
                my mashed swede & potatoes. So you are going to have to make a
                judgement call here. How cheap was your meat? How tough did it
                feel? This I can not help you with!
                <strong>Feel free to email me</strong> with what you actually
                have and I will happily try to help.
              </p>

              <h2>Option 3: The pressure cooker!</h2>

              <p>
                In a bit of a rush are we? Just pop the steaks and sauce into a
                pressure cooker for 25 mins while you cook your swede and
                potatoes. The job's a good one as they say :-)
              </p>

                Serve with swede and potato mash with some freshly steamed green
                vegetable. Not too much mind, as it is all about the meat &
                mash, as it always was! Spoon please mum :-P
