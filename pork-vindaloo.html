          Okay so it's Sunday but no roasting today, late night last night and I
          fancy some SPICE, so we're ditching the roast and having a Pork
          Vindaloo Curry made with just over 1/3 of a joint of shoulder pork. I
          bought a 1.5kg joint, removed the skin, sliced off some 2cm steaks and
          then diced them into small 2cm cubes. Now you are going to take a look
          at the ingredients list for my Pork Vindaloo Curry and think I'm nuts
          and be somewhat put off the thought of making it! I am obviously NUTS
          but stay with me here. Daunted? Don't be, it's actually a very simple
          curry if you're organised. Approach it step by step, have everything
          out on the surface, grab some little pots to hold your measured spices
          and ingredients, but above all else: remain calm ;-) This is a heavily
          spiced curry, it's flavour packed with spices and the unique taste of
          Kashmiri chillies, garlic and white wine vinegar make this an
          unforgettable dining experience. I use a similar base for Roast Pork
          Vindaloo as well as my Roast Chicken Vindaloo, the difference is;
          fresh meat needs nurturing as it does not have the umami flavours of
          roasted pork. But we're gonna fix that!
        </p>
        <p>
          So, my Pork Vindaloo Curry with fresh shoulder of pork. This is a
          recipe that I have created after many years of trying different
          things, but after I came across an old recipe for Portuguese Pork from
          the south-west of India, I finally realised what ingredients had been
          missing from my Pork Vindaloo curry!
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Tit-bit:</b> the name Vindaloo comes from the Portuguese words for
          wine and garlic, which are dominant flavours of this curry created by
          Indian chefs for the Portuguese during the colonial years 1505 to
          1961.

                  ><b>*Note:</b> the quality of the white wine vinegar makes a
                  difference. I find a Chardonnay adds a real depth of flavour
                  as well as the acidity, but, if you can't find that, use what
                  you can get hold of.</i

                <b>Note:</b> Buying a joint of pork, as I suggest in this
                recipe, costs far less than buying pre-packed diced meat -
                because the manufacturer has to pay someone to cut it up for you
                of course. I can make three dishes each serving at least four
                people per dish with the 1.5kg shoulder joint that I bought. The
                joint cost me £6 @ £3.79/kilo. That's twelve hungry mouths I can
                feed for six quid! So check out the price of the pre-packed next
                time you are in the supermarket and think twice before buying
                it!

              <h2>brown the onions</h2>
              <p>
                Once you have all the ingredients ready put your onions on to
                brown, as it is going to take about 20 minutes to get them to a
                golden brown colour that we need.
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>Take a heavy bottomed wok put it on med-high</li>
                <li>Allow the pan to heat up</li>
                <li>Add 3 Tblsp of oil to the pan</li>
                <li>When shimmering, add the onions</li>
              </ol>

              <div class="spacer"></div>
              <p>
                Don't be tempted to stir them constantly, just keep your eye on
                them while you prepare your spices:
              </p>

              <h2>toast the whole spices</h2>
              <ol start="5">
                <li>Heat a small flat bottomed pan to a med-high heat</li>
                <li>Tip in the whole spices to toast them</li>
                <li>Shake the pan occasionally to move the spices around</li>
                <li>Don't let them burn, keep moving them around.</li>
              </ol>
              <div class="spacer"></div>
              <p>
                When the spice aromas fill the air, tip them into a cold pot and
                allow them to cool completely.
              </p>

              <ol start="9">
                <li>Tip the whole spices into a grinder</li>
                <li>Grind down to a fine powder</li>
              </ol>

              <div class="spacer"></div>
              <p>
                You can use a pestle and mortar and some muscle power if you
                don't have a grinder to hand
              </p>

              <ol start="11">
                <li>Check your onions & turn gently</li>
                <li>Turn the heat down a notch if needed</li>
                <li>Combine all the ground spices into a pot</li>
                <li>Check your onions!</li>
              </ol>

              <div class="spacer"></div>
              <h2>prepare the meat</h2>
              <p>
                You need a large very sharp chef's knife for this:
                <img
                  src="./images/icons/chef-knife.png"
                  alt="chef knife"

                  style="width: 32px"
                  class="inline"
                />
                Take the pork joint & pat it dry with paper kitchen towel.
              </p>

              <ol start="15">
                <li>Cut the strings holding the joint together</li>
                <li>Carefully remove the skin from the joint</li>
                <li>Take as little fat off the meat as possible</li>
              </ol>

              <div class="spacer"></div>
              <p>
                Removing the skin is a bit like removing the skin from a fish.
                Get hold of one edge of the skin and score the fat underneath it
                to make a flap of skin that you can hold onto. Then, roll the
                joint over so that it is skin-side-down. Take hold of the skin
                flap with your knife blade as close to the skin as possible and
                then wiggle the skin backwards and forwards while pulling it at
                the same time. Your knife should cut through the fat easily but
                leave as much fat on the meat as possible, this will add lots of
                flavour to the dish.
              </p>
              <p>
                Put the skin aside when removed - you could make crackling later
                if you like.
              </p>

              <ol start="18">
                <li>Cut about 3 x 2cm thick steaks off the joint</li>
                <li>Cut the steaks into 2cm thick strips</li>
                <li>Cut the strips into 2cm cubes</li>

                *You can set the onion & spice mixture to the side in a dish if
                you are afraid of burning them. I actually set mine aside with
                the first batch of browned pork
              </p>

              <h2>Browning the pork</h2>
              <p>
                Brown the pork in 3 batches so that it doesn't take the heat out
                of the pan & begin to stew. If the pan doesn't remain hot, the
                meat will release water. We want to melt the fat from the pork &
                not release the water, this needs a very hot pan to make it
                happen.
              </p>
              <ol start="28">
                <li>With your pan hot on highest heat</li>
                <li>
                  Spread 1/3 of the diced pork in the empty side of the pan
                </li>
              </ol>

              <p>Once the curry starts to bubble with heat:</p>

              <ol start="43">
                <li>Turn the heat down to low-med & stir</li>
                <li>Cover and simmer very gently for 1 hour on low heat</li>
              </ol>

              <div class="spacer"></div>
              <p>
                <b>Note:</b> If you boil the curry for an hour the meat will
                become tough as old boots
                <img
                  src="./images/icons/boots.png"
                  alt="boots image"

                  class="inline"
                />
                So, simmer, simmer slowly so you can just see the odd bubble or
                two coming to the surface.
              </p>

              <h2>to finish the curry</h2>
              <p>
                Taste the curry sauce on a spoon, then take another bit and
                sprinkle with a little salt. If it tastes better than the first
                spoonful add ONE LEVEL teaspoon of table salt and stir well. If
                it's gone a little bit too far (a little too salty) add ONE
                LEVEL teaspoon of white sugar, mix well and taste again. It
                should now be perfect!
              </p>

              <p>
                <b>Tip</b> To cool the curry quickly I set my curry into a
                plastic pot and put it on top of a frozen block - The one that
                goes in my bag for chillin' drinks in the summer heat while
                we're out watching cricket in the sun.
              </p>
              <p>
                Put it into the fridge once cold and allow the magic to happen,
                the meat will take in all the flavours of the gravy over night
                and everything will just mature like a good well very good curry
                should :¬P
