        <p>
          I have been working on perfecting this recipe for
          <strong>Authentic Seekh Kebabs</strong> a good while now. I've tried
          different Pork & Beef mince mixes, but they turned out too wet and
          fell apart and low fat beef mince was too dry. Hmm! Well, finally I
          think this recipe is perfect. However, I shall let you all be the
          judge of that ;¬) You need to use full fat beef mince and be sure to
          pat it dry. Try to make the mix the day before, so it has time to
          chill and firm up in the fridge, then you should end up with perfect
          kebabs that are fit for very rich and politically powerful
          <em>men</em> with no teeth! LOL ;-)

                You definitely need to make the beef patty mixture well before
                cooking time, giving it enough time to chill and firm up in the
                fridge, otherwise they are just too soft to handle.

              <p>
                When you're ready to cook, be sure to space the kebabs out, do
                not crowd them or they will not cook evenly. I tried cooking
                these on my health grill, but, they tend to get crushed and
                flattened when you lower the lid! However, if you prefer that
                method, simply leave the lid up and turn frequently for 6
                minutes until they are almost done, then close the lid gently
                for the last 2 minutes and pray ;-) If they turn out looking
                like burgers "sighs" I did warn you! But, they will still taste
                great, I promise
              </p>

                Some place in India, quite a long time ago, a chef invented this
                dish for the rich and politically powerful men who had virtually
                everything they need in life, except of course, teeth! So, these
                <strong>Authentic Seekh Kebabs</strong> are so soft that teeth
                are optional! They are packed so full of flavour with quite a
                kick of chilli heat, so a cool mint raita and refreshing salad
                go down perfectly in between spicy meaty bites.
