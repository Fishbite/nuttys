          Sweet and sour chicken, whats not to love? Take away versions are
          great, but home made sweet and sour chicken, especially roasted
          chicken as I'm using here, will wipe the floor with them if you box
          clever. Now making this dish is bit like cooking Indian food;
          preparation is every thing! So get all your ingriedients out, grab
          some little pots and some storage containers. It'll be fine trust me
          ;-) I've broken this down into 3 stages:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>do the the chicken!</li>
          <li>do the the veg!</li>
          <li>do the the sauce!</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p>
          If you (or the kids) prefer a smooth sweet and sour sauce, you can
          blend the whole mixture down in a food processor, or use a handheld
          stick blender until it's a completely smooth like the little pots of
          sweet and sour sauce that come from the chinese take away, but, I
          leave my cooked vegetables whole as the star of the dish, it's a real
          grown up version of your sweet and sour chicken, I promise. Here I am
          using chicken legs that I'll roast separately in a coating of five
          spice powder and a couple of other flavour enhancing goodies. The
          result is totally amazing, I knew it'd be good (well, fairly sure
          lol!) when I was thinking of this, but WOW! This is really, really
          good!
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not your gloopy, clingy, gluey sauce that coats your chicken
          balls from the take-away. No! This is home made tangy, fruity, sweet
          and sour chicken, I want more deliciousness, with textures of fruit
          and veg that not just compliment, but, marry with the flavours and
          texture of the roasted chicken coated in spices.

                So, as I was saying, you can break this dish down into three
                stages:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>the chicken</li>
                <li>the fruit & veg</li>
                <li>the sauce</li>
              </ul>

              <div class="spacer"></div>

              <p>
                Each stage is really easy and if you have everything you need
                prepared in advance, it's a breeze to put this dish together. I
                used an air fryer to roast my chicken legs, but it's just fine
                to do them in a conventional oven, or even under the grill if
                you want. The cooking time is just a little shorter using an air
                fryer and there is no need to wait for it to heat up.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here's a couple of pics of how I prep' things for the sweet and
                sour chicken sauce:

                So, now that we are organised to make our sweet and sour sauce,
                we can concentrate on our chicken and get that started!
              </p>

                <li>Mix the garlic, ginger, salt & pepper together</li>
                <li>Pop the chicken in a food bag (preferably) or bowl</li>
                <li>Sprinkle in the remaining five spice powder</li>

                Everything should be ready now, so serve it while it is still
                piping hot, or, if you (or the kids!) want a smooth sauce, pop
                it into a food processor or use a stick blender to until it is
                the consistency that you want.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Note:</b> You might need to add a little more slaked
                cornflour to thicken the sauce again, because blending the
                mixture will release the juices from the fruit & veg' and make
                it a little thin. If so, pop the sauce back onto the heat to
                thicken it up again with a little more corn flour slaked in
                water.
              </p>
              <p>Pop the sauce into bowls ready for serving</p>
