        <p>
          So we are heading into autumn and I can feel the weather beginning to
          turn to those frosty mornings with dark evenings &mdash; the perfect
          combination for a slow cooked dish.
          <strong>Jamaican Beef & Butter Bean Curry</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          So um! Really? I question even Nutty! "just 300g of meat? Will it feed
          4". With some Nutty loves it will and I guarantee ya will smile. Add
          in a touch of spices and butter beans you have a perfect stewed curry
          dish full of Caribbean influences. I will cook this low and slow on
          the hob for 3 hours but you can of course use a pressure cooker for 30
          minutes or set it into a slow cooker for 6 hours. A paragraph
          explaination of each method is at the end of the method page.
        </p>

        <p>
          The dish requires very little meat just 300g as the butter beans add a
          huge amount of protein massively reducing cost but not at the expense
          of <strong>protein</strong> or indeed <strong>flavour</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          A nod to <em>Mama's kitchen</em> those were the days when paying for a
          take away was easy. I shall always smile over not my Mama's kitchen
          but a massive influence on my life and indeed what I cook. I can not
          fully replicate her. But oh my word I do try, as we all should.
          Soulful equates to from the heart. This is dish so full of
          <em>Mama's kitchen</em> soul feels like she typed it. Pretty sure it
          was Nutty but I'll never truely know...

                This dish is fast to put together but slow to cook. Once your
                meat is in to marinate allow a minimum of an hour but preferably
                marinade overnight in the fridge, or as long as you can.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have used Dunns River Hot Caribbean curry powder but any
                Jamacain style containing pimento (allspice) you prefer will be
                perfect. Check the powder for salt content increase the salt if
                required you can always add but never take away. So taste taste
                taste once the dish is near the end of the cooking time. Add in
                extra if required.
              </p>
              <p>
                The butter beans are going to soak up the meat & spice flavours,
                so trust me you will not feel hard done by.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now I used two pans &mdash; my non stick wok to fry with and
                then I switched to my dutch oven to slow cook the dish.

                <li>
                  Get a suitable container to marinate your meat in. Never metal

                  Chop your carrots, onions, spring onions and gather all your

                <li>
                  Heat a heavy based pan or Dutch oven to maximum add the 3 Tbsp
