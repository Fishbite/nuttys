          <strong>Jerked Pork Curry!</strong> Now this is different, totally
          different and no vegetables! I hear you screaming but Nutty! Well, I
          think you are in for a real treat here. This is one of my favourite
          foods &mdash; Jamaican! Years ago we had a lovely lady who prepared
          and delivered this amazing food! Sadly she never survived the cut
          throat fast-food environment we live in today. So, this recipe is
          homemade and as close to the taste of Jamaica that she delivered all
          that while ago, and as near I could get it trust me! I do not claim I
          can re-create what "Mamas Kitchen" delivered. But I will try!
        </p>
        <p>
          This is super quick and easy to put together. Then just let it sit in
          the fridge for a day to let those herbs and spices do their thing.

                <li>1 tsp Thyme leaves</li>
                <li>1 tsp Nutmeg</li>
                <li>1 Fresh Lime juiced</li>
                <li>1 tsp Salt</li>
                <li>1 tsp black pepper, corns crushed</li>
                <li>1 tin of plum tomatoes, mashed</li>
                <li>1/4 tin of water</li>
                <li>1 tsp sugar<strong>*</strong></li>

              <p>
                <strong>*</strong>This is purely a tomato & meat based curry so
                we need to reduce the tartness of the tinned tomatoes, white
                onion would usually achieve this, but a few spring onions will
                not. So, the trick is &mdash; just a level spoon of sugar!

                Now with Caribbean food &mdash; prepare to succeed! And, you
                really need to make this the day before you want to serve it. It
                will give the herbs and spices time to infuse into the gravy and
                meat, completely mellowing the taste of tomatoes, which are the
                predominant flavour when this curry is freshly made. Give it a
                day in the fridge though, and it will transform into something
                magical!

                Indian & Caribbean food is the same process, if you do not
                prepare and get all your stuff out up front &mdash; it's going
                to create stress!!! You're going to miss something, then you
                will not enjoy the cooking process &mdash; taking in the aroma
                of dinner simmering away with all the prep' and mess gone. Tough
                to learn, but if you have tried My Jerk Chicken, this is very
                similar, but in a gravy. Prepare &mdash; get done &mdash; wash
                up &mdash; then cook & enjoy the process, the satisfaction
                you'll feel once that process is mastered and your guests
                arrive, you will be chilled and confident &mdash; with not a
                ready meal in sight!

                I prefer to set this aside in the fridge for the following day
                "Sad face". But it, as with most really spicy food, tastes
                better the next day. I will admit to tasting today though, but
                hey! I'm a professional! It has to be done as dinner today was
                left over chicken soup! Everything relaxes & combines creating a
                harmony that is not there when first cooked.
