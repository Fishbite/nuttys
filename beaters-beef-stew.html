          So this stew is something I cooked for many years and one that was
          regularly enjoyed by the local shoots' Beaters all through the
          shooting season.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>
            Beaters' are the people country folk who are used to drive game
            birds for those doing the shooting. It is often a cold and tiring
            job so you need a substantial hot lunch. But as the lunch was free
            to around 20 to 30 people &mdash; it had to be
            <strong>low in cost</strong> &mdash; so it's perfect in the current
            crisis.
          </em>
        </p>

        <p>
          Packed with vegetables the only change (as this is for a dinner and I
          am only feeding us) is that I have used ale, but you can simply use
          water &mdash; it will still be wonderful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keep your slices and dices fairly large as we are going to cook this
          for 4 hrs low and slow. Lentils are added purely to thicken the stew
          and will disappear completely. You can of course use a slow cooker for
          8 hours or Pressure cooker for 45 minutes.

                I buy my Braising beef as whole steaks as you have full control
                over the dice.
              </p>

              <p>
                If you do not have moong dhal please use small yellow or red
                split lentils.
              </p>

              <p>
                Take time to slice and dice everything in advance &mdash; as
                evenly as you can. I have used tinned new potatoes as they hold
                their shape well and will not dissolve into the stew, but feel
                free to use fresh if you choose.
              </p>

              <p>
                Once everything is prepared, chopped and weighed &mdash; this is
                simple to fry off, just combine and cover and you will be free
                for 4 hours to do as you wish! I of course wrote up this recipe
                to share with you all, as Nutty often does! Once that job is
                done I may simply have a nice cup of tea ;-).

                Four hours later... and we have my delicious
                <strong>Beater's Beef Stew</strong>. Look at those potatoes!
                &mdash; no longer white, but soaked through with gravy and tasty
                as tasty can be! Absolutely packed full of flavour from all that
                beef, veg' and seasoning.

              <h3>Beef Beaters' Stew</h3>

              <p>
                Served with a simple homemade Yorkshire pudding to soak up that
                scrumptious, delectable gravy. Simple & delicious, but, with 4
                hours to ponder dumplings...hmm!
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Nutty's Tip:</strong>
                Now, if we were going to serve this with dumplings I would
                advise reducing the potatoes by half. The Beaters' got it served
                with a bread roll &mdash; which is of course an excellent idea.
