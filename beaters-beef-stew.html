        <p>
          So this Stew is something I cooked for many years and was regularly
          enjoyed by the local shoot Beaters all through the shooting season.
          Beaters are the people country folk are used to hearing drive game
          birds. It is often a cold and tiring job so you need a substaincial
          hot lunch. But as the lunch was free to arround 20 to 30 people it had
          to be low in cost so it's perfect in the current crisis. Packed with
          vegetables the only change as this is for a dinner and I am only
          feeding us, I have used ale but you can simply use water it will still
          be wonderful. Keep your slices and dices fairly large as we are going
          to cook this for 4 hrs low and slow. Lentils are added purerly to
          thicken the stew and will disapear completely. You can of course use a
          slow cooker for 8 hours or Pressure cooker for 45 minutes.

                I buy my Braising beef as whole steaks as you have full control
                over the dice. If you do not have moong dhal please use yellow
                or red lentils. Take time to slice and dice everything in
                advance as evenly as you can. I have used tinned new potatoes as
                they hold there shape well and will not dissolve into the stew,
                but feel free to use fresh if you choose. Once everything is
                prepared chopped and weighed this if simple to fry off combine
                cover and you will be free for 4 hours to do as you wish. I of
                course wrote up this recipe to share with you all, as Nutty
                often does once that job is done, I may simply have a nice cup
                of tea ;-).

              <h2>Serving suggestion</h2>
              <strong> Beef Beaters Stew </strong>
              <p>
                Served with a simple homemade Yorkshire pudding. Simple &
                delicous but with 4 hours to ponder dumplings...hmm! Ntty Tips -
                No if we were going to serve with Dumplings I would advise
                reducing the potatoes by half. The beaters got it served with a
                bread roll which is of course an excellent idea.
              </p>
