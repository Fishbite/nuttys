          Today I bring you a very old fashioned
          <strong>Steamed Sponge Pudding</strong> that is so easy to knock
          together. Served with fresh custard it is a delight in the late
          afternoon as a family treat, or, after an early Sunday roast when
          you've had time to let dinner go down! I'm going to put mine into a
          pressure cooker for 25 minutes as this is the fastest way to cook it.
          However, this can be made with a microwave, a pan of water or, in an
          electric steamer; the options are endless! The topping could be
          marmalade, strawberry jam or golden syrup, you could even use
          chocolate sauce, let your desires be fulfilled ;-)
        </p>

          to make my <strong>Steamed Sponge Pudding</strong> along with some

                I love the <em>'moment of truth'</em> when you finally tip this
                pudding out. Up until that point it's like a mystery parcel
                hidden from sight! It really is easy to make and cooking it in a
                pressure cooker has the job done in no time at all. The most
                important thing is to make sure that no water can get into your
                pudding as it is cooking away. I do this by covering the pudding
                bowl with baking paper and tin foil and then sealing it tightly
                with rubber bands, then I reinforce that with some string tied
                tightly around the bowl just to make double sure!
              </p>

                Hmmm! I really expected that jam to melt more than it did! Maybe
                I'll warm the jam and give it a whisk next time before spooning
                it into the pudding bowl. But, as it is, I don't think anyone's
                going to complain :¬P
              </p>
              <p>
                Serve with hot home made custard to delight the crowd! Or, you
                can use shop bought ready-made if you like, I just find that a
                little too sweet for my taste.
