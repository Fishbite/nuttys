          Christmas is nearly upon us! So, what better than making your own
          <strong>Sausage Roll & Caramalised Onion</strong>
          <strong>log</strong>. Yes! I do mean a <strong>LOG</strong>, one big,
          <em>humongous</em>, sausage roll! Firstly, check the size of your
          biggest baking tray, one that can accomodate the monster....I'm making
          this easy so you have plenty of time to make a home made Tomato
          Chutney too! :-P Ready rolled pastry, two packs of sausages and
          caramalised onions, simple!

              <p>
                <strong>Check for doneness</strong>: Use a meat thermometer, if
                you have one, and insert into the middle of the roll,
                temperature should be 75&deg;C to 80&deg;C. If you don't have a
                meat thermometer, insert a sharp knife into the center of the
                sausage roll for a few seconds, pull it out and touch the back
                of your hand, it should be too hot to keep it there!

                <strong>Sausage Roll & Caramalised Onion</strong> Now this is
                easy, a fork ;-0 and some of my home made tomato chutney. Guess
                what? I made that on the same day too & never even broke out
                into Nutty's stess mode! Admittedly, we had some shoe string
                fries, as waiting for the sausage roll to cool was torture!
