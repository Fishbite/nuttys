        <p>
          Well this is definately an Authentic recipe Nutty did not invent this,
          I've never had it in this country and in India you do not see Beef on
          the menu traditionally it would be made with Pork. Until James
          Martin's guest made it I was so excited my mind raced to India and my
          taste buds screamed you must make it now! So my next shopping trip I
          brought braising steak. Do not be daunted it is a chefs recipe but I
          have tried to break it down use accesssable ingriedients and indeed
          methods. The only change I have listed as optional is we found it a
          bit too on the mild side so added 2 tsp of extra hot chilli powder
          then we found it perfects ;-). Break it down into 3 sets of tasks make
          the paste day before make the vindaloo masala at the same time then
          you will have two little pots of majic all ready. You will need to
          dice your beef and marinade for 24 hrs in the vindaloo paste ready to
          cook the next day. Curtercy of Aktar Islam - Thank you Aktar for
          sharing this with us, Spiced Braised beef in vindaloo paste with
          coconut, tamarind and curry leaves. It is a myth that vindaloo
          contains potatoes! Vinegar and garlic should always be the base.

                First lets get the paste ready you will need a small frying pan,
                pestle & mortar or spice grinder and a small blender. Find a
                sealed pot large enough for all your meat and half your paste as
                this is enough for two curries. Gather all your ingriedients
                measure them and keep in order

              <p>
                The same frying pan pestle and mortar or spice grinder. A sealed
                pot to keep the masala in as this is enough for 4 to 5 recipes
              </p>

              <h2>Beef Vindaloo</h2>
              <p>
                Chose a non stick pan suitable to brown everything I then switch
                to an oven proff dish when ready to slow cook. The onions are
                going to take a while as we do need them well browned. Okay lets
                do this ting ;-)
