          It can be traced back to the Portugese settlers some while back!
        </p>
        <p>
          I've never tasted anything like it in this country and in India you do
          not see <em>beef</em> on the menu.
        </p>
        <p>
          Traditionally this <strong>Vindaloo</strong> would have been made with
          <em>pork</em>, that was until James Martin's guest @aktarislam made
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was so excited
          <img
            src="/images/icons/icons8-growing-heart-48.png"
            alt="icons8 growing heart"
            title="growing heart"
            style="width: 24px"
            class="inline"
          />
          my mind raced to India and my taste buds screamed
          <em>you must make it now!</em> So I bought braising steak on my very
          next shopping trip.
        </p>

        <p>
          Do not be daunted &mdash; it is a chefs recipe <em>but</em> I have
          tried to break it down using accessible ingredients and indeed
          <em>methods</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The only change I have listed as optional is because we found it a
          little bit too much on the mild side &mdash; so added 2 tsp of extra
          hot chilli powder &mdash; then we found it perfects ;-).
        </p>

        <p>Break it down into 3 sets of tasks...</p>

        <p>
          <span
            ><em
              ><ul>
                <li>make the paste the day before</li>
                <li>make the vindaloo garam masala at the same time</li>
                <li>marinate the beef for 24 hrs</li>
              </ul></em
            ></span
          >
        </p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <p>
          ...then you will have two little pots of magic all ready. You will
          need to dice your beef and marinade for 24 hrs in the vindaloo paste
          ready to cook the next day.
        </p>

              <h2>Vindaloo paste</h2>

              <p>
                you will need a small frying pan, a pestle & mortar or spice
                grinder and a small blender.
              </p>
              <p>
                Find a sealed pot large enough for all your meat and half of
                your paste as this is enough for two curries. Gather all your
                ingredients measure them and keep in order.
              </p>

              <div class="spacer"></div>

                The same frying pan, pestle and mortar or spice grinder. A
                sealed pot to keep the masala in &mdash; as this is enough for 4
                to 5 recipes

              <div class="spacer"></div>
              <h2>Beef Vindaloo</h2>
              <p>
                Choose a non stick pan suitable to brown everything &mdash; I
                then switch to an oven proof dish when ready to slow cook. The
                onions are going to take a while as we do need them well
                browned.
              </p>
              <p>Okay lets do this ting ;-)</p>

              <!-- Method List Goes Below Here!!! -->

              <h2>Vindaloo paste</h2>
              <p>
                So, get a plastic or glass container with a lid to marinate the
                beef in and add the following ingredients:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>150ml of white wine vinegar</li>
                <li>18g Kashmiri chillies</li>
                <li>2g turmeric</li>
                <li>1 - 2 tsp extra-hot chilli powder (optional)</li>
              </ul>

              <div class="spacer"></div>

              <p>
                Now peel your garlic and ginger and add them to the marinade pot
                while you prep' your whole spices.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Now for your whole spices:</strong></p>
              <p>
                Pre-heat an empty frying pan then add:
                <span>
                  <ul>
                    <li>10g black pepper</li>
                    <li>14 cloves</li>
                    <li>5g cinnamon stick,</li>

              <p>
                Gently warm through until they smell fragrant, then tip them
                into a pestle and mortar to cool.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once your whole spices have cooled &mdash; give them a bash and
                set into your spice grinder. Grind to a powder then transfer to
                a mini blender.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tip the ingredients soaked in vinegar (including the vinegar)
                into the blender.
              </p>

              <p>
                Blitz well till smooth then set half the paste into a sealed jar
                and the other half into your marinade pot.

              <h2>Beef Vindaloo</h2>
              <p>So 24 hours have passed and we have some more to prepare!</p>

              <p>
                First lets get our meat out of the fridge to warm and brown our
                onions.
              </p>

              </p>
              <ol class="spaced-ol">
                <li>
                  Heat oil in a heavy based pan, add onions and curry leaves and
                  caramelise till golden &mdash; about 20 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Now turn the pan to highest heat and add the marinated beef
                  along with all the marinade in the bowl. Rinse the bowl down
                  with a little water and set this aside to add to the pot along
                  with the tomatoes.
                </li>
                <li>Stir fry the beef until sealed and the oil separates</li>
                <li>Add chopped tomatoes</li>
                <li>Add the rinse-water from the marinade pot</li>
                <li>Another handful of curry leaves</li>
                <li>Cook till the tomatoes soften down</li>
                <li>Add the jaggery or sugar</li>
                <li>
                  Add the coconut milk and cook out again till oil separates
                </li>
                <li>A few more curry leaves - cook for a minute</li>
                <li>Add the tamarind</li>
                <li>Now pour in beef stock (water + stock cube).</li>
                <li>
                  Cover and simmer on low heat for 2 hours, keep stirring
                  occassionally so it doesn't catch.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <div class="spacer"></div>

              <p>
                Once 2 hrs are up and the beef is tender check the seasoning
                &mdash; I find that I need to add another &frac12; tsp of table
                salt.
              </p>
              <p>
                Uncover and turn the heat to medium to reduce the sauce until
                its thickened to your liking and the oil separates.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finish with 1 tsp of the vindaloo masala, check seasoning and
                adjust as necessary. Serve with any indian bread or rice.
              </p>
