          Now, I know fish dishes can be really tasty, but this
          <strong>Fish Fillets with Chilli Sauce</strong> dish is something
          else. It packs a punch! It's on a completely different level than fish
          & chips or fisherman's pie! You always hear chefs saying that a few
          simple ingredients are all it takes to make the best meal? Well, this
          is one excellent example of that. A simple marinade of lemon juice,
          oil, and coriander infuses the fish fillets with vibrant flavor...
          and, the chilli sauce is just as simple and quick to make, you will
          not believe such amazing tastes can be produced so easily.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm using quite an economical frozen white fish called Basa here, but,
          you could use any white fish you fancy, fresh or frozen. I've made
          this with Talapia in the past and it was just as good.
        </p>
        <p>
          This time, as a special treat, I made
          <strong>Saffron & Cardamom Rice</strong> to go with it. Head over to
          my

          while the fish is marinating, if you fancy trying that. It's well
          worth making :-)

                <li>2 Tbsp lemon juice</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp coriander - finely chopped</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp veg' oil</li>
                <li>4 lime wedges - to squeeze over the cooked fish</li>

              </ul>
              <div class="spacer"></div>

              <p>
                *I'm using Basa fillets, but you can use flat fish fillets such
                as Plaice or Sole as a more expensive alternative.
              </p>

              <div class="spacer"></div>
              <h2>for the chilli sauce</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>1 tsp ginger pulp</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp tomato puree</li>
                <li>1 & 1/2 tsp sugar</li>
                <li>1 tsp coarse sea salt</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp chilli sauce (West Indian Hot Pepper Sauce)*</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp malt vinegar</li>
                <li>300ml water</li>

              <div class="spacer"></div>

              <p>
                *Just use one or two teaspoons of chilli sauce to reduce the
                heat to your own taste - we like it with a bit of a kick here at
                Nutty's Kitchen though! Which chilli sauce to use? I use West
                Indian Hot Pepper Sauce made with Scotch Bonnet chillies :-P

                I'm using frozen Basa fillets for this recipe, as they're a lot
                cheaper than fresh Plaice or Sole fillets. So, if you want to
                use frozen too, just defrost them overnight in the fridge and
                pat them dry with kitchen paper before marinating them. If using
                fresh fish, pat them dry too before using.
              </p>
              <p>
                The marinade is very simple and consits of just: lemon juice,
                fresh coriander and vegetable oil. Just mix them together, then
                tip over the fish and rub it all over the fillets. Leave in the
                fridge for at least one hour before cooking.
              </p>
              <p>
                The chilli sauce is really easy to make, just mix all the
                ingredients together: ginger, tomato puree, sugar, salt, chilli
                sauce, malt vinegar and water, then bring to the boil and simmer
                until reduced to a thick soup-like consitency. You can make this
                in advance while the fish is marinating and then warm it up
                again when you are ready to cook the fish.
              </p>
              <p>
                To cook the fish, I simply tip all the marinade into a large
                flat warm pan (frying pan will do) on medium heat, then cover
                the pan with foil to create a steam trap. This helps to keep the
                fish beautiful and moist. Whatever you do, don't over-cook the
                fish, it only take a few minutes! How long exactly depends on
                the thickness of the fillets. My Basa fillets took about six
                minutes on a gentle simmer. Note that there is no salt added to
                the fish &mdash; it doesn't need it, as the rice and chilli
                sauce are seasoned enough.
              </p>
              <p>
                I serve this dish with
                <strong>Saffron & Cardamom Rice</strong> which you can also make
                while the fish is marinating:
                <a
                  class="in-link"
                  href="/saffron-and-cardamom-rice.html"

                  >saffron and Cardamom Rice Recipe</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                First things first though, gather all the ingredients together
                in separate stock piles for the fish and the chilli sauce.
              </p>

                Taste the sauce when reduced and add a little more sugar if you

                seasoned rice and the cooked fish infused with lemon and

                  simmer gently until the fish is just cooked - don't over cook
                  it, it will only take a few minutes, depending on the
                  thickness of the fillets. My Basa fillets took about 5- 6 mins

                Serve with <strong>Saffron & Cardamom Rice</strong> or even just
                plain boiled Basmati rice for something simpler, just make sure
                the rice is well seasoned.
