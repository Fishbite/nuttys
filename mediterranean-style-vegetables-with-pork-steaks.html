        <p>
          <strong>Mediterranean Style Vegetables with Pork Steaks</strong> This
          dish is a wonderful mix of carrots, courgettes, aubergine & sliced
          fresh garlic. You do need to do a fair amount of chopping, creating
          various sizes of vegetable batons, i.e. each type of veg' needs to be
          of a certain baton size, so that everything cooks evenly. Once that is
          done the dish is a breeze to put together. Italian dried herbs and
          oregano mixed with olive oil and tomato puree create a light sauce to
          compliment the vegetables. Delicious sliced peppers are added to the
          bake with seasoned pork steaks that go on top of the vegetables after
          partly cooking. A final summery florish of fresh marjoram will
          complete the dish with beautiful fresh sweet pine and citrus flavours
          which elevate the dish to another level.

                <li>1 large carrots cut into small batons</li>
                <li>1 large red onion cut into 12 through the core</li>
                <li>1 large courgette cut into medium batons</li>
                <li>2 aubergines cut into larger batons</li>
                <li>2 bowls water & lemon juice</li>
                <li>250g fresh baby plum tomatoes halved</li>
                <li>5 cloves garlic sliced</li>
                <li>3 Tbsp olive oil</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp tomatoe puree</li>
                <li>2 tsp dried italian seasoning</li>
                <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
                <li>1 vegetable stock cube crumbled</li>
                <li>a good grind of salt & pepper onto each layer</li>

              <div class="spacer"></div>

              <p>
                Please refer to the pictures as a guide for the size of your
                batons. This is important as the carrots will take the longest
                to cook, with aubergines taking the least.
              </p>

              <h2>Ingredients for the second bake</h2>

                Well! There's a little bit of choppin' to do for this dish, so
                now's the time to hone those knife skills! Pay attention to the
                size of those vegetable batons, the carrots particularly need to
                be the thinnest cut so that they have a chance of cooking before
                the soft veg' (aubergines, courgettes) turn to mush!
              </p>
              <p>
                Make sure you cut those cherry tomatoes in half before adding to
                the dish and save you and your guests from the experience of
                exploding scalding <em>'hot-bombs'</em> in the mouth! This is
                quite <strong>important!!!</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                And on that note, it's' of real benefit to let the dish rest &
                cool for a little while after you take it out of the oven. It
                just tastes better when not <em>'too hot'</em>. :¬)

              <p>
                Serving suggestion:
                <strong>Mediterranean Style Vegetables with Pork Steaks</strong>
                A big serving spoon, plates, knives, forks and if you wish
                &mdash; some baby new potatoes in chive butter "Simples" &
                Yummy!
              </p>
              <p>
                And, what to do with the left-over veg'? Well, I pulled some
                more pork steaks out and put them in a marinade of olive oil,
                lemon juice, garlic and paprika &mdash; just enough to coat them
                and left them in the fridge overnight. Next day, I simply
                seasoned them with salt and pepper, placed them into the health
                grill and re-heated the left-over veg'. 4 to 5 mins and I have
                dinner for day two! ;¬)
