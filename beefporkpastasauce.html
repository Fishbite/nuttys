          Now this is a favourite of mine.... Super tasty, perfect for any pasta
          dish you desire. Try my beef & pork pasta bake which is truly sublime.
          Combining the beef mince with pork ensures that everything stays
          succulently juicy, beef can become a little dry, especially if you use
          extra lean / reduced fat beef mince. Most importantly, the two
          together add a different level of flavour that is not achievable from
          either of the meats alone. As an added bonus the pork mince reduces
          the cost of the overall meal too!
        </p>
        <p>
          Feel free to use just beef or pork alone though, you will still have a
          fantastic dish to serve up.

                To make this dish you'll need to fry your meat in small batches
                to ensure that the pan stays hot throughout the browning
                process. If you try to do too much at once you'll find that the
                temperature of the pan drops and you will boil the meat as the
                water comes out too quickly to evaporate.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Note:</b> If you are going to use this pasta sauce for for a
                pasta dish such as spaghetti, add 1 tsp corn flour slaked into
                125ml of milk. This will thicken the sauce and also take the
                edge off the sharpness. The sauce as made here is quite tart,
                which is perfect when accompanied with a cheese sauce in dishes
                such as lasagnes or bakes

                <b>Top top tip</b> - Your not going to like this idea as your
                kitchen smells amazing and you just want too eat, but until
                you,ve tried it you will never believe me. Allow the dish to
                cool competely set it in the fridge over night and reheat the
                next day or even two days later and the taste will have matured
                and be even better!
