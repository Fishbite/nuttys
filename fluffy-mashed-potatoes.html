                The best potatoes to use for
                <strong>Fluffy Mashed Potatoes</strong> are the less
                <em>waxy</em> ones such as maris piper, king edwards etc. These
                have a high starch content and make perfect fluffy mash. General
                <em>all purpose</em> varieties make a good mash if you like a
                heavy rich consistency.
              </p>
              <p>
                Use a pan larger than required so you are not at risk of the
                water boiling over. Completely cover the rinsed potatoes and add
                a good tablespoon of salt. Once boiling, reduce the heat so that
                they just simmer gently and set a timer for 20 minutes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Check the potatoes after 20 mins.
                <em>I'm no stranger to some potatoes taking longer</em> than 20
                mins! You should be able to pierce them easily with a fork when
                they are ready to mash.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> Don't over mash the potatoes, just break
                them down with a potato masher and finish them off with a fork
                to get that perfect lump-free
                <strong>Fluffy Mashed Potatoes</strong>.

                Any dish with a gravy just calls out for the perfect
                <strong>Fluffy Mashed Potatoes</strong>. I've paired them here
                with my Mexican chicken, with its rich spicy tomato based sauce
                infused with the flavours of choritzo sausage. Mmmmmm! Yummy!
