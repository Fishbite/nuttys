          Now, I am really so excited to bring you this recipe, I gave you my
          pork version a little while ago, but, this time I made it with chicken
          thighs, just as another meat flavour alternative and have to tell you:
          I was not disappointed! In fact, I was so happy with the result I
          could have danced over the roof tops with joy!
        </p>
        <p>
          I sat down to eat with my <em>techie-guy</em> (he has to write stuff
          up so he gots to eat too!) so, last night we did and I have to say, it
          was a bit of an <em>I'm in heaven session!</em> I served
          <strong>Jerked Chicken Curry</strong> with a real grown up
          <strong>Blue Cheese Macaroni Pie</strong> and when we had finished he
          said <em>"That is truely food to calm the soul"</em> and we just
          looked at each other, grinning from ear to ear, eyes glazed with
          delight as if all our worldly troubles had melted away along with the
          cheese!
        </p>
        <p>
          Now this <strong>Jerked Chicken Curry!</strong> is different, totally
          different to the curries I normally make and it has no vegetables! I
          hear you screaming but Nutty! Well, I think you are in for a real
          treat here. This is one of my favourite foods &mdash; Jamaican! Now
          I've said this before, but, years ago we had a lovely lady who
          prepared and delivered this amazing food! Sadly she never survived the
          cut throat fast-food environment we live in today. So, this recipe is
          homemade and as close to the taste of Jamaica that she delivered all
          that while ago, and as near I could get it, trust me! I do not claim I
          can re-create what "Mamas Kitchen" delivered. But I will try!
        </p>
        <p>
          This is super quick and easy to put together. Then you just need to
          let it sit in the fridge for a day to let those herbs and spices do
          their thing. All you need to do next day is throw it in the wok and
          away you go <span class="rotatetext">{:-></span>

                <li>1 tsp Black peppercorns crushed</li>
                <li>1 Tin of plum tomatoes, mashed</li>
                <li>1/4 Tin of water</li>
                <li>1 tsp Sugar<strong>***</strong></li>
                <li>3 Spring onions, sliced to add to the curry</li>

                <strong>*</strong>I bought a new fresh thyme plant recently, as
                my old one had gotten really woody over the years. I can not
                encourage you enough to do the same! I didn't have to spend time
                picking leaves from the stalks (yippee!) and it made a massive
                difference to flavour of this curry.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>**</strong>Note I added a little more salt in this
                <strong>Jerked Chicken Curry</strong> and it really enhanced all
                those beautiful flavours. It makes me think that I should double
                check the seasoning on the pork version of this curry next time
                I make it.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>***</strong>This is purely a tomato & meat based curry
                so we need to reduce the tartness of the tinned tomatoes, white
                onion would usually achieve this, but a few spring onions will
                not. So, the trick is &mdash; just a level spoon of sugar!

                Now with Caribbean food &mdash; prepare to succeed! And, you
                really need to make this the day before you want to serve it. It
                will give the herbs and spices time to infuse into the gravy and
                meat, completely mellow the taste of tomatoes and allow that
                fresh thyme to shine through all the complex flavours of this
                curry. Give it a day in the fridge and it will transform into
                something truely magical!
              </p>

              <p>
                Indian & Caribbean food needs the same process, if you do not
                prepare and get all your stuff out up front &mdash; it's going
                to create stress!!! You're going to miss something, then you
                will not enjoy the cooking process &mdash; taking in the aroma
                of dinner simmering away with all the prep' and mess gone. Tough
                to learn, but if you have tried My Jerk Chicken Legs, this is
                very similar, but in a gravy. Prepare &mdash; get done &mdash;
                wash up &mdash; then cook & enjoy the process, the satisfaction
                you'll feel once that process is mastered and your guests
                arrive, you will be chilled and confident &mdash; with not a
                ready meal in sight!

                <strong>*</strong>I say this while being mindful of the chilli
                experience I had with Jerked Pork curry and the tissues I
                needed! I had spots of oil every where! Spitting is a thing with
                a wet paste, trust me it spits! Once it calms down wipe surfaces
                remove the lid & stir fry calmly :-)

                <li>
                  Once sealed, add the tomatoes & water then simmer gently for
                  another 30 minutes with the lid on
                </li>
              </ol>

                If the sauce looks thin <em>Don't Worry!</em> it's packed full
                of flavour and there's nothing in this recipe to thicken the
                sauce. It either thickens or it doesn't and there's something
                kind of luxurious about it when thin.

                Once made, I prefer to set this curry aside in the fridge for
                the following day
                <span class="rotatetext">:-(</span> because, this, as with most
                really spicy food tastes better the next day. However, I will
                admit to serving it straight away today though, but hey! My
                grown up <em>blue cheese macaroni pie</em> was ready straight
                out of the oven. There's no way I was going to allow it to
                chill, we were hungry!
