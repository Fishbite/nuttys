        <h2>a bit of history</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Cottage Pie</strong>, a really old-fashioned dish that has
          never fallen from grace. The word "Cottage" relates to farmers
          cottages and this is made with beef mince then topped with a creamy
          "Mash" potato topping and baked in the oven, hence it being called a
          "Pie". It dates back to 1791 when the price of potatoes in England and
          Ireland became affordable. Richer people had folk to make Pastry to
          contain their meat in, so the <em>Mash Pie</em> was created, but no
          one knows by whom. I've tried to find out gave up. But yes, I do
          applaud them though, who can imagine a life with out <em>Pie!</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          I do love a Meaty-Potato-Mash-Pie! Regarded way back as inexpensive
          &mdash; so it has to feature in Nutty's Kitchen dishes, it's a true
          classic! I could add that Shepherd's Pie, which I call Lamb Mash Pie
          is the same process and always was. My nan & my mum made it with
          sliced carrots and slices of onions that you could see in the served
          dish ( Sorry MUM ) but I make all that disappear into the meat. A bit
          o' historical studying later - more knowledge - it's obvious you would
          think? But NO! Mutton was used in
          <strong>Cottage Pie</strong> too!!! Confused? Join the club.
          <em>NO ONE</em>
          truely knows but, in the 20th century
          <em>The practice of Cookery and Pastry 1854</em> said
          <em>"Cold dressed meat of any kind roasted or boiled"</em> this comes
          from<em> Thomson House Cottage Pie: A History</em> &mdash; fascinating
          stuff...Okay NVM I have a feeling ya all stopped listening. The
          history of food is a mine field - So lets cook! Toasty savory and
          softly wonderful beefy stuffs

                Finely chopping veg into mince size please! I wack them all into
                a food processor with the blade attachment give a stir and
                repeat hence the need to then add the the sliced onions. Our
                time cooking is precious & enjoyable. But if I have a gadget to
                do it for me? What's not to love!

                Try not to replace Bovril with Marmite it is definitely NOT
                going to work, there's <em>No Beef in Marmite&trade;</em> - save
                that for ya toast! If you do not have Bovril add another beef
                stock cube & or, if your wallet allows, red wine &mdash; No
                gravy granules please, its just not allowed!
              </p>

              <p>
                I as usual double the quantity of filling with vegetables,
                adding flavour and healthily bulking out the meat. As we all
                know, we eat far too much of it. But, who can resist rich beefy
                ragu style minced beef topped off with hot creamy mash :-) Now I
                controversially add a tin of baked beans in it's own tomato
                sauce, you can choose not to but, once I've put them into mine
                adding protien and that thing I adore - flavour! I have yet
                again stretched my pennies as I pay 35 pence for a tin! So this
                is similar to my Corned Beef Mash Pie and makes a really
                comforting dinner on a cold winters night

              <p>
                *Ensure your mash is quite wet as the meat mixture is fairly
                dry. Add more milk &/or butter to make the mash softer. This is
                how to make your mash creamy and totally lump free - Use a whisk
                or fork to cream the mash and get rid of every lump, if you try
                to do it with just the potato masher, it can become overworked
                and starchy turning into a gloopy paste.
              </p>

              <p>
                Now get a large dish and set your meat mixture in the bottom -
                go for a 50/50 ratio of meat and mash depth that ensures a
                crispy topping &mdash; use a large dish to maximize the amount
                of crunchy golden toasted topping, a deeper dish will give you a
                wetter pie with not so much crunch!
