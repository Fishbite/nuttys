          Now if you love a take away fried rice and a roast dinner that tiny
          bit of left over roast pork is going to create <em>magic</em> &mdash;
          If ya keep some from the fridge raiders who make sandwiches while you
          sleep! I have a wok full of deliciousness with just 150g of roast pork
          and the real end bit that's all toasted as well. It's fast and easy,
          just prepare, prepare and double check you're prepared! I eat this on
          it's own as a main meal with a vege' garnish of onions carrots &
          beansprouts, don't worry, I'll add it into accompaniments soon enough.
          But what an amazing side is <strong>Pork Fried Rice</strong> to go
          with chilli chicken or sweet & sour, excited yet? If you're not, well,
          your missing out on the point and that's nine meals out of one joint
          of pork (about 1.5kg) so far this week :¬) a £6 joint used wisely, now
          do you get it?

                First set your rice to soak in a pan or something &mdash; we
                want all the starch gone. Stir around, rinse and repeat a few
                times until the water runs clear. Set aside in a sieve. Now move
                on to dicing all the other components. The size of dice here is
                important, in fact the most important & time consuming task. Do
                everything double the size of peas & corn as a rule of thumb.
                Or, same thickness as your middle finger "Laughs". Put your
                potatoes into water with the same rational &mdash; to remove the
                starch. Yes! Dicing evenly takes some work! But if you get your
                dice right, your individual components will cook perfectly, with
                some stir frying to begin with and then finally covered for 20
                mins until the dish is done perfectly. Nothing is mushy or
                tasteless, nothing is hard most importantly! A large sharp knife
                makes it easy to prepare the veg and if you put everything into
                little pots ready to chuck into the pan you will fly through the
                cooking process of this <strong>Pork Fried Rice</strong>. You
                start by adding stuff on a high heat, then nurture the dish
                calmly with the serenity of a Geisha girl! Playing with a very
                hot wok

                we do not want here, which is exactly what's gonna happen if
                your trying to chop with your pan on hot...! Also we need this
                to be fast as our ring's very hot and expensive to use :¬{

              <p>
                I make my <strong>Pork Fried Rice</strong> the day before and
                set it onto frozen cooling block to bring the temperature down
                faster and then put it in the fridge overnight. So, tomorrow all
                I need to do is either make a main meat dish, or a vegetable
                accompaniment. Reducing stress in the kitchen is important and
                besides there was nothing on the tv anyway! My rice will absorb
                every flavour and relax like the meat. Tomorrow it'll be
                reheated and this Nut's gonna have a day off. Just a fast quick
                vegetable garnish to do ;-)
                <strong
                  ><em
                    >Please be sure to cool fast and freeze or, use the next day
                    if not eating immediately.</em
                  ></strong
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                Now i'm gonna blow your mind, I might steal a bit in the
                morning, whisk an egg or two and create an
                <em>Omurice</em> &mdash; a simple Japanese fried rice omelette.
                I love this! I made breakfast and dinner with 150g of &mdash; ta
                be honest &mdash; stuff peeps chuck away &mdash; dry meat. Well
                I am Nutty:-)
