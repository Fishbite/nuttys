        <p>
          <strong>Balti butter chicken</strong> now this is an amazing curry
          that many will know from Indian restaurants & take always. Buttery
          creamy delicately spiced and great for a dinner party or just a home
          away evening. I'm betting you assume you can not make it at home or
          that it's complicated. Well actually it is really easy to make. Yes
          there are a lotta ingredients might be a big knickers job. But
          basically once you have ground your spices and added them to yogurt &
          tinned tomatoes your ready to cook it is that simples! Now you can use
          Greek yogurt but definitely do not also add the cream! Unless you can
          not handle spice the cream & Greek yogurt will make a extremely mild
          curry. It's a fat ratio science thingy that is way too complicated for
          now.

                Now I am using left over roast chicken for my
                <strong>Balti butter chicken</strong> as the mariande refreshes
                the meat. None of that dry left over chicken feeling here @
                Nuttys kitchen. But there is really very little difference in
                the method using raw. Just be sure to check that the raw chicken
                is cooked through with a temperture guage or take a piece break
                it open if it white inside it's cooked. Another tip try to use
                thighs if your going to cook for longer as breast drys out much
                more easily.
              </p>

              <p>
                Now I'm doing this today for a basic dinner. If I was doing it
                for a dinner party, well that's special & of course I would want
                to show off a bit more! I would want that authentic tandoor char
                on my chicken obviously it's a must. But as of yet I do not have
                a tandoor oven in my gadget range! Very annoying. So what you
                will need to do is after your meat's been marinated. Place it
                all into a colinder allow the majority of the mariade to drain
                off the chicken pieces. Spray the chicken with some of the
                melted oil ghee mixture of drizzle which evers easier. Now place
                the chicken under a very hot grill or into an air fryer turning
                once half way through. It will only need 2 to 4 minutes each
                side maximum depending on the size of the pieces. Place
                remaining oil & ghee into a hot pan once melted do your onions
                as above add your sauce and stir fry then add your grilled
                chicken & finish as above with chilli & corriander ;-)
                Simples....
